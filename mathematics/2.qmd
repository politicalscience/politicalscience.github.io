This module will discuss key topics in Calculus, which many methods, including statistics and game theory, build on. We start off derivatives, what they are, and how to find them. Then, we discuss how to use derivatives for optimisation - an important concept in most methods. Finally, we introduce integration - a key part of statistics and probability theory

# Chapter 1: Derivatives

### 1.1: Definition of Derivatives

A derivative function $f'(x)$, has the value at $x$, which is equal to the rate of change of $f(x)$ at $x$

-   Basically, [derivatives measure the "slope"]{.underline} of any point of $x$ on $f(x)$

-   For linear functions, $f'(x)$ is a constant value - since linear functions have a constant slope

-   For curved functions, $f'(x)$ is not constant - since the slope is not constant. $f'(x)$ is thus equal to the slope of the line [tangent]{.underline} to the curve at point $x$

<br />

How do we normally measure slope?

-   Well, we do change in $y$ over change in $x$, which more mathematically, is $(y_1 - y) / (x_1 - x)$

-   We can rewrite this in function form by replacing $y$ with $f(x)$ as follows: $[f(x_1) - f(x)] / [x_1 - x]$

-   We can further rewrite $x_1$: what is $x_1$ conceptually? It is a point that is some distance from $x$.

    -   We can represent that distance between $x_1$ and $x$ as $h$

    -   Thus, $x_1 = x + h$

-   Thus, finally rewriting, we get the slope is $[f(x+h)-f(x)] / [(x+h) - x ]$

-   We can simplify the denominator so we get: $[f(x+h)-f(x)] / [h ]$

<br />

However, the normal way of finding slope involves finding two different points, and the slope between them

-   However, a derivative is the slope at one specific point, not between 2

So how do we do this?

-   To find the slope at one specific point, we can slowly reduce the size of $h$ (the $x$ distance between the two points), until it reaches $0$

-   Remember limits from *Module 1: Topics in Algebra*?

-   Thus, we can make $h$ approach $0$ by doing the following limit: $\lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0}$.

-   This will tell us the value of the slope between two points, where the distance between two points gets increasingly small, all the way until the two points merge into one, which is the derivative!

<br />

So, let us apply this limit of $h$ as it approaches $0$ to our slope formula we found above:

$$
f'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0 } \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
$$

[That is the formal definition of a derivative]{.underline}

-   If we want to find any possible derivative, we can use that function (although, sometimes, it will be very difficult algebraically)

<br />

So far, I have used apostrophes (ex. $f'(x)$ ) to represent derivatives of functions.

-   We can also use the form $\frac{dy}{dx}$ to express derivatives

    -   This literally means - the change in $y$ over the change in $x$ - we can substitute $y$ and $x$ if we are using different variables

-   Sometimes, we want to take the derivative of a derivative (this will become clear later)

    -   We can notate this with an additional apostrophe: $f''(x)$

<br />

### 1.2: Calculating Derivatives

Like I said above, you can calculate the derivative of any function by plugging it in to the definition of a derivative

-   However, this can be very difficult algebraically due to the complexity of some functions

<br />

Luckily for us, there are a few generalised forms of functions, whose derivatives are consistent when applied to the definition of a derivative.

These rules allow us to quickly calculate derivatives. The most important are underlined:

-   [Power Rule]{.underline}: $[x^k]' = kx^{k-1}$

-   [Sum Rule]{.underline}: $[f(x) ± g(x)]' = f'(x) ± g'(x)$

-   [Constant Rule]{.underline}: $[\alpha f(x)]' = \alpha f'(x)$

-   Product Rule: $[f(x)g(x)]' = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$

-   Quotient rule: $[f(x)/g(x)] = [f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)]/[g(x)]^2$

-   [Linear Rule]{.underline}: $[mx]' = m$, where $m$ is a constant

-   [Derivative of a constant]{.underline}: $[c]' = 0$, where $c$ is a constant

-   Chain Rule: $[f(g(x))]' = f'[g(x)] \times g'(x)$

-   Exponential rule: $[e^x]' = e^x$

-   Exponential Nested Rule: $[e^{u(x)}]' = e^{u(x)} \times u'(x)$

-   Non-base $e$ Exponential: $[b^x]' = \ln (b) \times b^x$

-   Natural Log Derivative: $[ \ln (x)]' = 1/x$

-   Log power derivative: $[ \ln(x^k)]' = k/x$

-   Nested Log Derivative: $[ \ln (u(x)) ]' = u'(x) / u(x)$

<br />

### 1.3: Examples of Derivatives

**Example 1 (Sum, Product, Constant Rules):**

Find $f'(x)$ if $f(x) = 5x^4 - 6x^3 + x^2 - 5x + 6$

-   1st, split up the function using sum rule: $f'(x) = [5x^4]' - [6x^3]' + [x^2]' - [5x]' + [6]'$

-   2nd, use linear rule and derivative of a constant on the final 2 sections: $[5x]' = 5, [6]' = 0$

-   After that, we have: $f'(x) = [5x^4]' - [6x^3]' + [x^2]' - 5 + 0$

-   3rd, use constant rule to simplify: $f'(x) = 5[x^4]' - 6[x^3]' + [x^2]' - 5$

-   4th, use chain rule: $f'(x) = 5(4x^3) - 6(3x^2) + (2x) - 5$

-   5th, multiply out: $f'(x) = 20x^3 - 18x^2 + 2x - 5$

<br />

**Example 2 (Product Rule):**

Find $f'(x)$ if $f(x) = (x^3)(2x^4)$

-   We know the product rule says: $[f(x)g(x)]' = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$\$

    -   Thus, in our equation, $f(x) = x^3, g(x) = 2x^4$

-   Then, find the derivative of both parts

    -   $f'(x) = 3x^2$ (Power rule)

    -   $g'(x) = 2[x^4]' = 2(4x^3) = 8x^3$ (constant rule, power rule)

-   Now, put it into the product rule: $f'(x) = (3x^2)(2x^4)+(x^3)(8x^3)$

-   Simplify by multiplying and exponent rules: $f'(x) = 6x^6 + 8x^6 = 14x^6$

<br />

**Example 3 (Chain Rule, Power Rule, Sum Rule):**

Find $f'(x)$ if $f(x) = (3x^2 + 5x - 7)^6$

-   This is a nested composite function, so we use chain rule: $[f(g(x))]' = f'[g(x)] \times g'(x)$

-   Identify the parts that of our initial function that fit the chain rule parts:

    -   So in the chain rule format, $f(x) = x^6, g(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 7$

-   Now, find the derivatives of both parts:

    -   $f'(x) = 6x^5$ (power rule)

    -   $g'(x) = 3[x^2]' + [5x]' - [7]' = 6x+5$

-   Now, let us fit it into the chain rule format: $f'(x) = 6(3x^2 + 5x - 7)^5 \times (6x+5)$

-   Distribute out $6x+5$: $f'(x) = 36x(3x^2+5x-7)^5+30(3x^2+5x-7)^4$

<br />

# Chapter 2: Partial Derivatives

### 2.1: Partial Derivatives

Suppose that we have a function $f$, with 2 or more input variables

-   However, we are only interested in the rate of change, relative to one of the variables

We can do this through a partial derivative. A partial derivative is formally defined as:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} f(x_1,...,x_i,...,x_n)
$$

$$
= \lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{ f(x_1, ..., x_i + h, ..., x_n) - f(x_1, ... , x_i, ..., x_n )}{h}
$$

-   Where $x_1, ..., x_i, ..., x_n$ are all different input variables of $f$

-   Where we are only interested in the rate of change in respect to $x_i$

    -   Hence why only $x_i$ has a $+h$ in the denominator

-   As a result, we treat $x_1,... x_n$ that are not $x_i$, we treat them simply as a constant (like how you would treat the number $5$)

Note: we use the partial sign $\partial$ instead of $d$ in the derivative notation to indicate a partial derivative.

<br />

To solve a partial derivative:

-   [Treat all other variables other than the one we are interested in, simply as constants]{.underline} (exactly how you would treat the number $5$ in their position)

-   Treat the variable you are interested in with the same derivative rules previously discussed

<br />

**Example:**

Given the function $f(x,z) = 5x^2z^3 + 2x + 3z + 5$, find the partial derivative in respect to only $x$

-   1st, let us do the sum rule: $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[f(x,z)] = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} [5x^2z^3] + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}[2x] + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}[3z] + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}[5]$

-   Now, let us look at each part:

    -   $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[5x^3z^3] = 5z^3 \times \frac{\partial}{\partial x}[x^2] = 5x^3(2x) = 10z^3x$ (Remember, treat $z^3$ as a constant - since it is not what we are interested in)

    -   $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} [2x] = 2$ (linear rule)

    -   $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[3z] = 0$ (since $z$ is treated like a constant)

    -   $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} [5] = 0$

-   Now, put the parts together: $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(x,z) = 10z^3 x + 2$

<br />

### 2.2: Application: Regression

You probably have heard that linear regression allows us to "hold all other variables constant" and look at the relationship of one variable

-   If you haven't, don't worry, this is covered in the Statistical Methods module on Linear Regression

Well, we can actually mathematically prove this!

<br />

Take the multiple linear regression model with explanatory variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_p$:

$$
\hat{y} = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_1x_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 x_2 + ... \hat{\beta}_p x_p
$$

Let us say we are interested in isolating the effect of $x_1$ on $y$. We can do this by taking the partial derivative in respect to $x_1$

$$
\frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial x_1} = \frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial x_1}[\hat{\alpha}] + \frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial x_1} [\hat{\beta}_1x_1] + \frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial x_1} [\hat{\beta}_2 x_2] + ...
$$

Since $x_2,...$ are all treated as constants, the partial derivative in respect to $x_1$ is:

$$
\frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial x_1} = 0 + \hat{\beta}_1 + 0 + 0 + 0.... = \hat{\beta}_1
$$

[Thus, the effect of $x_i$ on $\hat{y}$, holding all other variables constant, is $\hat{\beta}_1$]{.underline}

-   Thus proving the assumption of multiple linear regression

<br />

Partial Derivatives can also be used to isolate the effect of a moderating effect variable. Take this following moderating effect regression model (don't worry, we will cover this in the Statistics section)

$$
\hat{y} = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_1 x_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 x_2 + \hat{\beta}_3 x_1 x_2
$$

Now, let us find the effect of $x_1$ on $\hat{y}$ by taking the partial derivative in respect to $x_1$

$$
\frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial x_1} = 0 + \hat{\beta}_1 + 0 + \hat{\beta}_3x_2
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial x_1} = \hat{\beta}_1 + \hat{\beta}_3 x_2
$$

<br />

# Chapter 3: Optimisation

### 3.1: Slope and Concavity

In the previous chapter, we discussed how derivatives are the rate of change of a function.

From this we know the following:

-   If $f'(x) < 0$, then $f(x)$ is decreasing

-   If $f'(x) > 0$, then $f(x)$ is increasing

-   If $f'(x) = 0$, then $f(x)$ is neither increasing or decreasing

<br />

[Concavity is whether a curve opens upward or downward]{.underline}

-   A function is concave up when it opens upward (like $y=x^2$ )

-   A function is concave down when it opens downward (like $y = -x^2$)

But, what makes a function open upward or downward?

-   It is actually the rate of change, of the rate of change, of the function

-   Or in other words, the derivative of the derivative, or also called the second order derivative

<br />

Thus, a [based on the second order derivative of a function, we know if it is concave up or down]{.underline}:

-   If $f''(x) < 0$, then $f(x)$ is concave down

-   If $f''(x) > 0$, then $f(x)$ is concave up

-   If $f''(x) = 0$, then $f(x)$ is neither concave up or down

<br />

Thus, given this, we can find the concavity of a function based on its second derivative

-   For example, take $f(x) = x^2$

-   The first derivative is $f'(x) = 2x$ (power rule).

-   The second order derivative is $f''(x) = 2$

-   $2>0$, so we know the function is concave up

-   This makes sense - we know the graph of $f(x) = x^2$ opens upward

<br />

### 3.2: Finding Mininums and Maximums

A minimum and maximum value of a function is just what it sounds like - at what point does the function output the highest or lowest value?

-   There can be two types of minimums/maximums: global and local

-   Global minimums/maximums are the minimum/maximum point of the entire function's possible inputs

-   Local minimums/maximums are like the local peaks/valleys of a function - they might not be the highest/lowest point in the entire function, but they are within their neighbourhood

Why is this important? Well often in political science, we are either trying to maximise utility functions, or minimise error in our models

<br />

How do we find minimums and maximums?

1.  We have to find $f'(x)$, and what value of $x$ makes $f'(x) = 0$
    -   So basically, we find the derivative, and solve for $x$ when we set the derivative equal to $0$
    -   Why? Well, think about maximums and minimums - they are when the slope of a function reverses - either positive $\rightarrow$ negative, or negative $\rightarrow$ positive
    -   [Thus, $f'(x) = 0$ is the point when they reach their minimum/maximum]{.underline}
2.  Then, we have to find the value of $f''(x)$ at the $x$ value we found in step one
    -   If $f''(x) > 0$ (or concave up), we have a minimum
    -   If $f''(x) < 0$ (or concave down), we have a maximum
    -   Why? well if a function is concave down (opening downwards), then clearly, there is a maximum point. Vice versa

<br />

Often times, we will have to find a minimum and maximum over an [interval]{.underline}

-   We do the same process as above

-   HOWEVER, [we also have to check the $f(x)$ value outputted at our interval boundaries]{.underline}

    -   Why? let us take the function $y=x$, or any other function that goes towards infinity or negative infinity, as $x$ goes towards infinity or negative infinity

    -   These cases, we are often only finding the local minimum/maximums, as the global ones are infinity

    -   Often times, depending on the interval, the edge (where the function is headed towards infinity/negative infinity) is the actual maximum/minimum in our interval

<br />

**Example:**

Find the maximum value of the function $f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x$ on the interval $[0,3]$

-   1st, find the first derivative: $f'(x) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12$ (power, sum, constant rule)

-   2nd, find when $f'(x) = 0$

    -   So we have to find $0 = 6x^2 - 18x + 12$

    -   We can first take out common factor 6: $0 = 6(x^2 - 3 + 2)$

    -   Now factor: $0 = 6(x-2)(x-1)$

    -   So the two $x$ values which make $f(x) = 0$ are $x=2, x=1$

-   3rd, find the second derivative: $f''(x) = 12x-18$ (power, sum, constant rule)

-   4th, plug in our $x$ values we found that make $f'(x) = x$

    -   When $x=1$, $f''(1) = 12(1)-18 = -6$

    -   When $x=2$, $f''(2) = 12(2) - 18 = 6$

-   A maximum is when $f''(x) < 0$, so only $x=1$ is a maximum

-   Now, plug in $x=1$, as well as the edge cases $x=0, x=3$

    -   $f(0) = 0, f(1) = 5, f(3) = 9$

-   Thus, the edge case $x=3$ where $f(x) = 9$ is our maximum

<br />

### 3.3: Optimisation in Linear Models

Finding minimum and maximum values is often called [optimisation]{.underline}. This is frequently used in Game Theory and Statistics.

For example, in statistics, we often want to create a linear model that best represents our data

-   The linear model takes the form $y = \beta x$

-   However, in social science, no relationship is a perfect, one to one correlation. There is always some variation/randomness

-   Thus, we need to add an error term: $y = \beta x + \epsilon$

<br />

To make the best linear prediction, we need to find a line with some value $\beta$ based on our data, that minimises the squared error $\epsilon^2$

-   Why squared error? Well, we will cover this more in depth in the module on Regression Analysis, but essentially, squaring the error removes the difference between negative and positive errors - after all, we are considered with the magnitude of error, not direction

<br />

How do we minimise squared error $\epsilon^2$?

-   1st, let us solve for $\epsilon^2$ in our linear model

    -   Our linear model is $y = \beta x + \epsilon$

    -   Now, isolate $\epsilon$: $\epsilon = y - \beta x$

    -   Now, square both sides: $\epsilon ^2 = (y- \beta x)^2$

-   Now, let us call the above function $\epsilon^2 = f(\beta) = (y-\beta x)^2$. We want to minimise this function (and thus, the squared error)

    -   How do we minimise? follow the same steps as previously discussed!

-   Let us find the first derivative of $f'(\beta)$. We will need the chain rule:

    -   Remember, chain rule says $[f(g(x))]' = f'[g(x)] \times g'(x)$

    -   Let us identify the parts of $f'(\beta)$ that fit the chain rule: Let us make $f(\beta) = \beta^2$, and $g(\beta) = y - \beta x$

    -   Now, find $f'(x), g'(x)$: $f'(\beta) = 2 \beta, g'(\beta) = -x$

        -   Remember, we are finding the derivative in respect to $\beta$, so $-x$ is just a constant for our purposes

    -   Now, plug into chain rule: $f'(\beta) = 2(y-\beta x) \times -x$

    -   Simplify: $f'(\beta) = -2x(y - \beta x)$

-   Now, set $f'(\beta) = 0$ to find $\beta$ values that might be minimums

    -   So we solve for $\beta$ given: $0 = -2x(y-\beta x)$

    -   First, multiply out: $0 = -2xy + 2x^2 \beta)$

    -   Isolate $\beta$ on one side: $2x^2 \beta = 2xy$

    -   Divide both sides by $2x^2$: $\beta = 2xy / 2x^2$

    -   Simplify: $\beta = xy/x^2$

-   So, we know $f''(\beta)=0$ at $\beta = xy/x^2$. Now, let us take the second derivative of $f(\beta)$ to check if this is a minimum:

    -   Previously, we found $f'(\beta) = -2x(y-\beta x)$

    -   Multiply out: $f'(\beta) = -2xy - 2x^2 \beta$

    -   Find the derivative of $f'(\beta)$ in respect to $\beta$: $f''(\beta) = 0 + 2x^2$

        -   Remember, we are finding the derivative in respect to $\beta$, so $x$ and $y$ are just constants for our purposes

    -   Now we know $f''(\beta) = 2x^2$. Since $x^2$ will always be positive, we know that $f''(\beta) > 0$ at all points, and thus, it is concave up, and has a minimum

-   Thus, $\beta = xy/x^2$ is the value of $\beta$ which minimises our simple linear model

<br />

It is important to note that this isn't the actual formula for linear regression minimisation

-   Why? we only used one $x$ and $y$ value in this example

-   But in reality, we will have vectors $X$ and $Y$ - so many more points with different $x$ and $y$ variables

-   We will discuss this later

<br />

### 3.4: Constrained Optimisation

Sometimes, we have constraints when optimising functions

-   For example, if a company is spending on advertising, it may only have a certain amount of money to allocate to advertising

To illustrate constrained optimisation, I will introduce an example and walk through how to solve it. Other constrained optimisation problems will have a similar workflow.

<br />

Let us take the function $f(x,y) = xy$

-   We want to maximise this function

However, we have a constraint: $x+y = 10$

-   Imagine this scenario as a firm with 2 options - investing in TV advertising or YouTube advertising, but only with a budget of \$10

To solve this constrained optimisation, we do the following:

-   1st, solve for one variable within the constraint

    -   Our constraint is $x+y=10$

    -   Let us solve for $y$: $y = 10 - x$

-   2nd, substitute this version of the constraint into the function

    -   Plug in $y=10-x$ into $f(x) = xy$

    -   We get $f(x) = x(10-x)$

    -   Multiply out to get: $f(x) = -x^2 + 10x$

-   Now, find the first derivative, and set it equal to 0 to check for maximums and minimums

    -   $f'(x) = -1[x^2]' + [10x]'$

    -   $f'(x) = -2x + 10$

    -   Now, set $'f(x)=0$: $0 = -2x+10$

    -   Solve for x: $2x = 10, x = 5$

-   Now, find the second derivative to check if our $x$ value is a maximum

    -   $f''(x) = [-2x]' + [10]'$

    -   $f''(x) = -2$, thus concave down, thus a maximum exists

-   Now, we know $x=5$ is a maximum. Plug it into the constraint to find $y$

    -   $(5) + y = 10$

    -   Solve for $y$: $y = 5$

-   Now, we know $x=5,y=5$ is a maximum. Plug in to $f(x,y)$ find the maximum value:

    -   $f(5,5) = 5 \times 5 = 25$

<br />

# Section 4: Integrals

### 4.1: Indefinite Integrals

[An integral is the opposite of a derivative]{.underline}. We notate an integral in two ways:

$$
F(x) = \int f(x)dx
$$

For example, if we have the equation $y = x^2$

-   The derivative, would be $y' = 2x$

-   If we do the integral of the derivative $\int 2xdx = x^2 + c$

-   As you can see, the integral is the opposite of the derivative

You might ask, what is the $+c$ doing? That is the constant of integration.

-   Remember, the derivative of a constant is 0.

    -   Ex. the derivative of $x^2+2$ would be $2x$ as well

-   So, the $+c$ represents a potential constant that may be there in the original derivative

<br />

Integrals can be significantly more difficult to calculate than derivatives. Luckily, there are a few rules we can use (most of them are the opposite way around of derivative rules):

1.  [Constant rule]{.underline}: $\int \alpha f(x)dx = \alpha \int f(x)$
2.  [Sum rule]{.underline}: $\int [f(x) + g(x)]dx = \int f(x)dx + \int g(x)dx$
3.  [Reverse power rule]{.underline}: $\int x^n dx = \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + c$
4.  Integral of an exponential: $\int e^xdx = e^x + c$
5.  Reverse natural log rule: $\int \frac{1}{x}dx = \ln x + c$
6.  Nested exponential integral: $\int e^{f(x)} f'(x) = e^{f(x)} + c$
7.  Nested power rule: $[f(x)]^n f'(x)dx = \frac{1}{n+1}[f(x)]^{n+1} + c$
8.  Reverse nested log rule: $\int[ (f'(x)) / f(x) ] = \ln f(x) + c$

<br />

**Example 1:**

Find $F(x) = \int f(x)dx$ where $f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1$

-   We know sum rule means: $F(x) = \int [3x^2]dx + \int [2x]dx + \int[1]dx$

-   We know that constant rule: $F(x) = 3 \int [x^2]dx + 2 \int[x^1]dx+\int[1]dx$

-   Using power rule, we know: $F(x) = 3 \left[ \frac{1}{2+1}x^{2+1} \right]+2 \left[ \frac{1}{1+1}x^{1+1} \right] + x + c$

-   Simplifying: $F(x) = 3 \left[ \frac{1}{3} x^3\right] + 2 \left[ \frac{1}{2} x^2 \right] + x + c$

-   Multiplying out: $F(x) = x3 + x2 + c$

<br />

**Example 2:**

Find $F(x) = \int f(x)dx$ where $f(x) = e^x e^{e^x}$

-   First, we know that $[e^x]' = e^x$

-   Thus, using nested exponential rule: $\int e^{f(x)} f'(x) = e^{f(x)} + c$

```         
-   Let us say $f(x)=e^x$, thus $f'(x) = e^x$
```

-   Uing nested exponential rule: $F(x) = e^{e^x} + c$

### 4.2 Riemann Sums

[Integrals are not only the opposite of derivatives - they are also a function for the area under a curve.]{.underline}

-   For example, if we have function $f(x)$, then the area under $f(x)$ can be calculated with the integral $F(x) = \int f(x)dx$

-   We can add boundaries for the area between points $x=a$ and $x=b$: $\int\limits_a^b f(x)dx$

<br />

Before we get into this, let us first think about how we would calculate the area under the curve

-   Non-linear curves don't form really any clear geometric shapes, making it hard to calculate the area under them

However, we can approximate the area under the curve using rectangles. See the figure below:

![](riemann-sum.png){width="60%"}

Notice how that with more rectangles, our approximation becomes more and more accurate

-   And with more rectangles, each rectangle's width is reduced

<br />

How do we calculate the area of a rectangle? Of course - width $\times$ height

-   The width of the rectangles above, let us call $\Delta x$ (change in $x$)

-   What is the height? Well, it is the value of $y=f(x)$, the actual function

So, the height of each rectangle is $f(x) \times \Delta x$

<br />

Thus, to get the area under the curve, we can sum up all the rectangles, as follows:

$$
\int\limits_a^b f(x)dx = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\Delta x
$$

However, as we discussed, as each rectangle becomes smaller, the area is more accurate.

How do we make each rectangle infinitely smaller? That is right - a limit: make the width of each rectangle approach 0!

Thus, the formal definition of an integral between 2 points is as follows:

$$
\int\limits_a^b f(x)dx = \lim\limits_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \Delta x
$$

<br />

That is called a [Riemann Integral]{.underline} - a way to calculate the definite integral (area under the curve between points $a$ and $b$)

-   A Riemann integral can, in theory, calculate any definite integral

-   However, this is often very very time consuming. Luckily for us, the next section discusses a way around this!

<br />

### 4.3: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

So far, we have discussed Riemann Integrals - however, we noted, they are not the most efficient way to solve an integral.

Luckily for us, the [fundamental theorem of calculus states]{.underline} that - if the following conditions are met:

1.  Function $F$ is continuous on an interval $[a,b]$
2.  The derivative of function $F, F'(x) = f(x)$
3.  The function $f$ is Riemann Integrable

Then, the following statement is true:

$$
\int\limits_a^b f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

Essentially, this means [by finding the indefinite integral (as we did a few lessons ago), we can find the definite integral (area under the curve) quite easily, just by plugging $a$ and $b$ into the indefinite integral!]{.underline}

<br />

**Example:**

Find the area under the curve between $x=(1,5)$ for the function $f(x) = 3x^2$

-   First, let us find the indefinite integral

    -   Constant rule: $\int f(x)dx = 3 \int [x^2] dx$

    -   Reverse power rule: $\int f(x)dx = 3 \left[ \frac{1}{1+2} x^{2+1} \right] + c$

    -   Simplify: $\int f(x)dx = 3 \left( \frac{1}{3} x^3\right) +c = x^3 + c$

-   Now, fundamental theorem says: $\int\limits_1^5f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)$

    -   $\int\limits_1^5 f(x)dx = F(5) - F(1) = (5)^3 + c - (1)^3 + c$

    -   $\int\limits_1^5 f(x)dx =125 - 1$

    -   $\int\limits_1^5 f(x)dx = 124$

<br />

### 4.4: Integration by Subsitution

Sometimes, an indefinite integral doesn't seem to be solvable based on the rules given in the indefinite integral lesson.

Integration by substitution is a trick that we can try (although not always possible)

If a function takes the form of $f[u(x)] u'(x)$ (or we can find some $u$ that we can manipulate it into that form), then the integral is:

$$
\int f[u(x)]u'(x) = F[u(x)]+c
$$

This rule is derived from the chain rule, but in reverse

<br />

**Example:**

Let us solve the following integral: $\int x^2 \sqrt{x+1}dx$

There are actually two ways to solve this - I will explore both.

<br />

[Approach 1]{.underline}

The issue with the integral $\int x^2 \sqrt{x+1}dx$ is the $\sqrt{x+1}$ part - we have no rule to deal with it. If everything is in terms of $x^k$, things would be much easier.

-   So, let us substitute the $x+1$, so $u = x+1$

-   Given this substitution, we can isolate $x$ to be $x = u - 1$, thus $x^2$ (to fit the first part) is $x^2 = (u-1)^2$

-   Let us also solve $u'(x)$, which is $u'(x) = [u-1]'=1$

Now, with these substitutions, we can plug it back into the equation:

-   $\int x^2 \sqrt{x+1}dx = \int(u-1)^2 \times \sqrt{u} \times 1$

-   The first part $(u-1)^2 \times \sqrt{u}$ is the original equation $f(x)$ substituted to become $u(x)$, and the second part $1$ is $u'(x)$

-   Thus, it is in the form required: $\int f[u(x)]u'(x) = F[u(x)]+c$

Now, we need to find $F$. So, let us integrate $\int(u-1)^2 \times \sqrt{u} \times 1$

-   Expand the squared term and rewrite square root to: $\int (u^2-2u+1) \times u^{1/2}$

-   Multiply across: $\int (u^2 \times u^{1/2}) - (2u \times u^{1/2}) + (1 \times u^{1/2}$

-   Simplify: $\int u^{5/2} - 2u^{3/2} + u^{1/2}$

-   Now, we can integrate with sum and reverse power rule

-   $\int u^{5/2} - 2u^{3/2} + u^{1/2} =$

-   $= \frac{1}{5/2+1}u^{5/2+1} + 2 \times \frac{1}{3/2+1}u^{3/2+1} + \frac{1}{1/2+1}u^{1/2+1}+c$

-   $= \frac{2}{7}u^{7/2} + \frac{4}{5}u^{5/2}+ \frac{2}{3}u^{3/2}+c$

-   We can factor out $2u^{3/2}$ to get: $2u^{3/2} \left[ \frac{1}{7}u^2 + \frac{2}{5}u + \frac{1}{3} \right] + c$

Now, with $F$, we can subsitute $u(x)=x+1$ back into $F$ as specified: $\int f[u(x)]u'(x) = F[u(x)]+c$

-   Thus, $= 2(x+1)^{3/2} \left( \frac{1}{7} (x+1)^2 - \frac{2}{5} (x+1) + \frac{1}{3} \right) + c$

<br />

[Approach 2]{.underline}

Like before, The issue with the integral $\int x^2 \sqrt{x+1}dx$ is the $\sqrt{x+1}$ part. Instead of substituting the $x+1$, why don't we substitute the entire section $\sqrt{x+1}$

-   So, $u= \sqrt{x+1}$

-   Let us solve for $x^2$ to fit the first section

    -   Square both sides: $u^2 = x+1$

    -   Isolate $x$: $x = u^2 - 1$

    -   Square both sides: $x^2 = (u^2-1)^2$

-   Find $u'(x) = [u^2-1]' = 2u$

Now, with these substitutions, we can plug it back into the equation:

-   $\int x^2 \sqrt{x+1}dx = \int(u^2-1)^2 \times u \times 2u$

-   The first part $(u^2-1)^2 \times u$ is the original equation $f(x)$ substituted with $u$, and the second part $2u$ is $u'(x)$

-   Thus, it is in the form required: $\int f[u(x)]u'(x) = F[u(x)]+c$

Now, let us expand and multiply out the terms:

-   $= \int 2u^6 - 4u^4 + 2u^2$

Now, we need to find $F$. So, let us integrate $\int 2u^6 - 4u^4 + 2u^2$

-   $= 2 \left[ \frac{1}{7} u^7 \right] + 4 \left[ \frac{1}{5} u^5\right] + 2 \left[ \frac{1}{3} u^3 \right] + c$

-   $= \frac{2}{7} u^7 - \frac{4}{5} u^5 + \frac{2}{3} u^3 + c$

-   Factor out $2u^3$: $=2u^3 \left( \frac{1}{7}u^4 - \frac{2}{5}u^2 + \frac{1}{3} \right) + c$

Now, with $F$, we can subsitute $u(x)=x+1$ back into $F$ as specified: $\int f[u(x)]u'(x) = F[u(x)]+c$

-   $=2(\sqrt{x+1})^3 \left( \frac{1}{7}(\sqrt{x+1})^4 - \frac{2}{5}(\sqrt{x+1})^2 + \frac{1}{3} \right) + c$

-   $= 2(x+1)^{3/2} \left( \frac{1}{7}(x+1)^2 - \frac{2}{5}(x+1) + \frac{1}{3} \right) + c$

Same as the first approach!

<br />

### 4.5: Integration by Parts

Integration by parts is another way to find integrals

Just like how integration by substitution was the "opposite" of chain rule, integration by parts is the "opposite" of the product rule.

Integration by substitution says:

$$
\int u(x) v'(x)dx = u(x)v(x) - \int v(x) u'(x)dx
$$

If we can find expressions that fit $u(x)$ and $v'(x)$, we can get the integral

<br />

**Example:**

Our goal is to evaluate the following: $\int \frac{\ln (x)}{x^2} dx$

-   Let us make $u(x) = \ln (x)$, and $v'(x) = 1/x^2$

-   This fits the format $\int u(x) v'(x)dx$ required

Now, let us find $u'(x)$ and $v(x)$

-   $u'(x) = [\ln(x)]' = \frac{1}{x}$ (see derivative rules)

-   $v(x) = \int v'(x)dx = \int x^{-2}dx = \frac{-1}{x}$

Now we know $u(x), u'(x), v(x), v'(x)$, we can fit it into the integration of parts formula $\int u(x) v'(x)dx = u(x)v(x) - \int v(x) u'(x)dx$ to find the integral:

-   $= \ln(x)\left( \frac{-1}{x}+c \right) - \int \left[ \frac{-1}{x} \times \frac{1}{x} \right]dx$

-   $= \frac{- \ln (x)}{x} + c - \int \frac{-1}{x^2}dx$

-   $= \frac{- \ln (x)}{x} + c - \int -x^{-2}dx$

-   $= \frac{- \ln (x)}{x} + c - (-x^{-1} + c)$

-   $= \frac{- \ln (x)}{x} - \frac{1}{x} + c$

-   $= \frac{- \ln (x)+1}{x} +c$

<br />
