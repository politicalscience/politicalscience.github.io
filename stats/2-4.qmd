# Uniform Distribution {#uniform}

A uniform distribution is created when a continuous random variable $Y$ has the same probability for every possible outcome.

-   For example, take a continuous random variable that has the possible outcomes of any real number between $a$ and $b$.

-   Every possible outcome has the same probability.

-   Thus, when graphing the probability function $f(y)$, we get a straight horizontal line - i.e., for every possible outcome, the probability is the same, hence the same height for all values of $y$

<br />

There are some properties of a Uniform Distributions of a random continuous variable $Y$, with possible outcomes of all real numbers between $a$ and $b$

-   If the outcomes are all between $a$ and $b$, $f(y) = \frac{1}{b-a}$

    -   This is because the probability is uniform, so the probability of each outcome $y$ is just 1 divided by the total amount of outcomes.

    -   The variable $y$ never appears in the probability density function $f(y)$, since the distribution is uniform - i.e. the probability of an outcome is the same for all $y$.

-   The mean of random variable $Y$ is $E(Y) = \frac{a+b}{2}$

-   The variance of random variable $Y$ is $V(Y)=\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$

<br />

One common use of uniform distributions is in random number generators, where every number between $a$ and $b$ is allowed to be generated, and has the same probability of being generated.

# Normal Distribution {#normal}

Normal distributions are arguably the most important distribution for understanding inferential statistics.

Normal distributions famously take the "bell curve" shape as shown in the image below:

<br />

As we see in the image above, there are a few properties of normal distributions:

-   The mean $\mu$ and median $\tilde{x}$ are equal, and sit in the exact centre of the distribution.

-   The distribution is symmetrical on both sides of the mean $\mu$

<br />

Furthermore, percentage of area under the curve remains constant in all normal distributions, no matter the actual value of the standard deviation $\sigma$ (as shown above in the figure)

-   Within one standard deviation $\sigma$ of the mean $\mu$ on both sides, there contains 68.26% of the total area under the curve.

-   WIthin 2 standard deviations $2 \sigma$ of the mean $\mu$ on both sides, there contains 95.44% of the total area under the curve.

-   Within 3 standard deviations $3 \sigma$ of the mean $\mu$ on both sides, there contains 99.72% of the total area under the curve.

Why is this useful?

-   Well remember, area under the curve of a probability density function is the probability of an event occurring.

-   Thus, if some random variable is in a normal distribution, just by knowing the standard deviation, we can calculate the probabilities of a certain outcome.

-   This idea will become extremely useful in statistical inference.

<br />

A normal distribution's probability density function can be written as following, assuming that $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation:

$$
f(y)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} * \sigma} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma ^2}}
$$

<br />

Normal distributions are frequently used in hypothesis testing, since the standard deviations $\sigma$ allow us to calculate the probability of a sample mean being in a certain interval. We will discuss more on this in sampling and inference.

# Binomial Distribution {#binomial}

Binomial distribution is a discrete distribution for discrete random variables:

-   Suppose we have a binary random variable - yes/no or success/fail.

-   Binomial distributions record the number of "successes" observed in multiple trials of the random variable.

For example, if we flip a die 10 times, assuming we want heads (heads is our success category), what is the probability of getting each possible amount of successes?

-   A binomial distribution would plot all possible outcomes 0 to 10, and the probability associated with each.

<br />

Binomial Distributions must meet the following criteria:

1.  Number of observations/trials is fixed - we are doing an action a specified amount of times (ex. flipping a coin exactly 10 times)
2.  Each observation/trial is independent - one observation doesn't affect the next (ex. flipping the first coin doesn't affect the odds of the second coin).
3.  The probability of success for each observation/trial must be the same (ex. flipping a coin, whether the 1st or 10th time, is always a probability of 0.5 of getting heads).

<br />

The binomial distribution takes the following probability mass function (see [1.3 Counting](https://politicalscience.github.io/stats/1-3.html) for more info on how combination works):

$$
p(y)= \binom ny p^y q^{n-y}
$$

Where:

-   $y$ is the number of successes (can take the value of 0 all the way to the number of observations/trials $n$)

-   $n$ is the number of trials

-   $p$ is the probability of success in any trial

-   $q$ is the probability of failure in any trial, which, according to probability rules, is also $q=1-p$

-   $p(y)$ is the probability of a certain number of successes $y$

<br />

These are a few extra properties of binomial distributions:

-   Mean $\mu = E(Y)= n*p$

-   Variance $\sigma ^2 = npq$

<br />

Binomial distributions are useful for the implementation of Logistic Regression.

# Poisson Distribution {#poisson}

A Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution for discrete random variables:

-   It measures the probability of a given number of events, occurring in an interval of time

For example, consider a tech support call centre:

-   It generally, on average, receives 3 calls per minute during the entire day.

-   Assume that the random event of receiving a call is independent - the timing of the first call does not change the probability of when the next will occur.

-   What are the chances of receiving less than 3 calls? What are the chances of receiving at least 5 calls? The Poisson distribution plots this.

<br />

The probability mass function of a Poisson distribution is:

$$
p(y) = \frac{\lambda ^ y}{y!} e^{- \lambda}
$$

Where:

-   $\lambda$ is the expectation/average number of events that generally occurs within the time interval.

-   $y$ is the number of occurrences we are interested in.

-   and $p(y)$ tells us the probability of $y$ occurrences occurring.

<br />

The Poisson distribution has a very unique feature: Its expected value equals the variance:

$$
E(Y) = \sigma ^2 = \lambda
$$

<br />

The Poisson distribution is often used to model rare events, and is used in the Poisson regression for counts. For example, it can be used to predict the number of civil wars in a time period.
