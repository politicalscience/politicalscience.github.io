This is an introduction to statistical thinking and probability theory for Political Science. This course is about building the foundations for the applied methods taught in subsequent courses.

Probability theory and statistical theory is essential for regression analysis, causal inference, and game theory.

<br />

Prerequisites: Officially, none, but some understanding of [Maths for Political Science](https://politicalscience.github.io/math/) up to single variable calculus would be helpful.

<br />
