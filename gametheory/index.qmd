## Syllabus

These notes provide a detailed but approachable introduction to game theory and economic-style modelling for political science (and other social sciences). These notes are useful for anyone who wants to understand game theory for reading research papers, or for developing their own models.

This course is split into 2 parts:

1.  Game Theory Concepts: Discuses the key concepts in game theoretic modelling.
2.  Applied Game Theory: Applies game theory to researching political phenomena.

**Prerequisites**: Strong skills in algebra and single variable calculus. Strong understanding of probability (especially Bayes' Rule). You can undertake this course without these skills, but you may struggle a little.

<br />

## Part I: Game Theory Concepts

1.  Preferences, Utility, and Basics of Game Theory
2.  Dominant Strategies and Nash Equilibrium
3.  Further Topics in Nash Equilibrium
4.  Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium
5.  Downsian Model of Electoral Competition
6.  Further Spatial Models
7.  Sub-game Perfect Nash Equilibrium
8.  Further Dynamic Games
9.  Games of Imperfect and Incomplete Information
10. Bayesian Nash Equilirbium
11. Bayesian Perfect Equilibrium
12. Signalling Games
