# Syllabus

This guide provides a detailed introduction to econometric theory and methods of causal inference. This guide is useful for anyone who wishes to do serious quantitative/statistical research in the social sciences.

This course is split into two sections:

1.  Econometric Theory: provides the basic statistical and econometric theory needed to econometric analysis
2.  Applied Econometrics: Takes the theory learned, and applies it to research designs in order to find causal effects. This section will also contain examples of R-code to facilitate implementation.

**Prerequisites**: Single Variable Calculus, and Basic Probability and Statistical Theory (probability, random distributions, expectation and variance). Some linear algebra is also helpful.

<br />

# Part I: Econometric Theory

This part provides the essential theory needed for econometric analysis. We focus on a few of the most important estimators in econometrics.

1.  [Bivariate Regression and Ordinary Least Squares](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/theory/1.html)
2.  Multiple Regression and Ordinary Least Squares
3.  Statistical Inference with Linear Regression
4.  Further Topics in Linear Regression
5.  OLS and Methods of Moments Estimator
6.  Instrumental Variables Estimator
7.  Logistic Regression and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
8.  Multinomial and Ordinal Logistic Regression
9.  Regression for Counts

<br />

# Part II: Applied Econometrics

This part takes the theory on estimators learned previously, and applies them to research designs and frameworks in order to estimate causal relationships.

11. Introduction to Causal Frameworks
12. Randomised Controlled Trials
13. Selection on Observables with Regression
14. Selection on Observables with Matching and Weighting
15. Instrumental Variables for Non-Compliance
16. Further Instrumental Variables Designs
17. Regression Discontinuity Designs
18. Differences-in-Differences
19. Survey Experiments
