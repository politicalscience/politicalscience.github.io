## Syllabus

These notes provide a detailed but approachable introduction to statistical and econometric theory, and how these are used in social science research designs. These notes are useful for anyone who wishes to do serious quantitative/statistical research in the social sciences.

This course is split into two parts:

1.  Econometric Theory: The theory behind statistical inference and econometrics.
2.  Applied Econometric Methods: how to apply theory to actual research designs for causal inference.

**Prerequisites**: Strong skills in algebra and single variable calculus. Basic linear algebra is helpful. You can undertake this course without these skills, but you may struggle a little.

<br />

## What to Learn Next

These following courses can be useful in applying statistical methods to social science research:

-   [Multivariate Statistical Methods](https://politicalscience.github.io/multivariate): Focuses on topics of measurement of unobservable (latent) variables with multivariate methods.
-   [Applied Machine Learning](https://politicalscience.github.io/machine): Focuses on how we can use modern methods to increase predictive power.
