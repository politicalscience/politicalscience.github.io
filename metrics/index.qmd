## Overview

This is a course on econometrics for social scientists. This course will introduce how to analyse real-world data to evaluate causal hypotheses in the social sciences.

**Prerequisites**: I highly recommend one has a solid understanding of calculus and basic statistical theory. Specifically, I assume knowledge through the first part of the quantitative methods (for social scientists) course covering single variable calculus and introductory statistical theory.

-   This course will also provide code for implementation of methods in R. However, this course is not a course in the R-programming language.

## **Part I: Introduction to Causal Inference**

In this first part, we will introduce the idea of causality, and explore the "gold standard" of causal inference: randomisation.

1.  [Causality and Counterfactuals](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/1/1.html)
2.  [Randomised Controlled Experiments](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/1/2.html)

## Part II: Relationships in Observational Data

In this part, we will start exploring ways to measure relationships between variables when we cannot run controlled experiments.

4.  Simple Linear Regression
5.  Multiple Linear Regression
6.  Extensions of the Linear Model
7.  Issues with Regression in Causal Settings

## Part III: Causality in Observational Studies

In this part, we go from the correlation of regression and try to reach causal conclusions while dealing with observational data.

8.  Selection on Observables Designs
9.  Instrumental Variables Estimator
10. Extensions of Instrumental Variables
11. Panel and Longitudinal Data
12. Differences-in-Differences
13. Regression Discontinuity
14. Survey Experimental Design

## Part IV: Measurement of Variables

In this part, we discuss ways to measure variables that are not inherently measurable, in order to use them for statistical analysis.

15. Exploratory Factor Analysis
16. Confirmatory Factor Analysis
17. Latent Trait Models
18. Latent Class Models
19. Cluster Analysis
20. Structural Equation Modelling

## Part V: Advanced Topics

In this part, we discuss advanced estimators and topics that are not essential in econometrics.

21. Logit Models and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
22. Multinomial and Ordinal Logistic Models
23. Regression for Counts
24. Principle Components Analysis
