## Syllabus

This is a course on econometrics for social scientists. This course will introduce how to analyse real-world data to evaluate causal hypotheses in the social sciences.

**Prerequisites**:

-   The first course: Very Applied Econometrics. While this technically is not neccesary, it helps give a "bigger picture" of what this course is about.

```
-   Knowledge of single variable calculus, basic probability and statistical theory, and some notions of linear algebra are required.

<br />

## Part I: Econometric Theory of Estimators
