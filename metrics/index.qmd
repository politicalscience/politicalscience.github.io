# Overview

This is a full course on econometrics for social scientists. This course will introduce how to analyse real-world data to come to conclusions. Topics include estimating causal effects, causal inference, forecasting & prediction, as well as measurement problems.

This course is divided into 3 main parts, each which focus on a major topic in econometrics. It is recommended that you start in order.

**Prerequisites**: I highly recommend one has a solid understanding of calculus and basic statistical theory. Specifically, I assume knowledge through the first part of the quantitative methods (for social scientists) course covering single variable calculus and introductory statistical theory.

This course will also provide code for implementation of methods in R. However, this course is not a course in the R-programming language. I assume a basic understanding of variables, functions, data frames, and packages.

# Part 1: Causal Inference and Estimation

This part of the course will focus on techniques of causal estimation and causal inference, which is important in establishing causal relationships for social science research.
