## Syllabus

These notes provide a detailed but approachable introduction to statistical and econometric theory, and how these are used in social science research designs. These notes are useful for anyone who wishes to do serious quantitative/statistical research in the social sciences.

This course is split into 3 parts, with each part having a series of chapters (which include sections).

1.  Fundamental Econometric Theory: The theory behind statistical inference and econometrics.
2.  Applied Econometric Methods: how to apply theory to actual research designs for causal inference.
3.  Advanced Statistical Concepts: explores more advanced topics, including further regression models, multivariate statistics, and latent variable measurement.

**Prerequisites**: Strong skills in algebra and single variable calculus. Basic linear algebra is helpful. You can undertake this course without these skills, but you may struggle a little.

## What to Learn Next

I recommend learning the [Applied Machine Learning](https://politicalscience.github.io/machine) course, which builds on methods from this course, but focuses on how we can use modern methods to increase predictive power.
