# Syllabus

This course provides a detailed introduction to statistical and econometric theory. This guide is useful for anyone who wishes to do serious quantitative/statistical research in the social sciences.

-   Note: This course is only on the theory of statistics/econometrics. If you want to implement these methods for research, you will need to consult the subsequent applied econometrics/statistics courses.

This course is also a pre-requisite for the subsequent applied econometrics/statistics courses:

-   [Applied Econometrics: Causal Inference](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal)
-   [Applied Statistics: Multivariate Methods](https://politicalscience.github.io/multivariate)
-   [Applied Statistics: Prediction and Forecasting](https://politicalscience.github.io/prediction)
-   [Applied Statistics: Quantitative Text Analysis](https://politicalscience.github.io/text)

**Prerequisites**: Strong skills in algebra and single variable calculus. Basics of statistics (what a random variable is, what probability is, some ideas behind distributions). Basic linear algebra is helpful.

-   You can undertake this course without these skills, but you may struggle a little.

<br />

# Part I: Basics of Statistical Theory

This part provides the basics of statistical concepts, theory, and discusses statistical inference.

1.  Introduction and Basics of Statistics
2.  Estimates and Statistical Inference
3.  Relationships with Correlation and Covariance

<br />

# Part II: Ordinary Least Squares Estimator

This part explores the most commonly used estimator: the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Estimator, and how it can be useful for estimating relationships between variables.

4.  Simple Linear Regression: Basics and Estimation
5.  Simple Linear Regression: OLS Properties and Inference
6.  Multiple Linear Regression: Basics and Estimation
7.  Multiple Linear Regression: OLS Properties and Inference
8.  Extensions of Linear Regression

<br />

# Part III: Further Estimators

Sometimes, OLS is not a good estimator. This part explores other estimators and models, and how they can be used to solve some of the issues with OLS and linear regression.

9.  Method of Moments Estimator
10. Instrumental Variables Estimator
11. Logistic Regression and the Maximum Likelihood Estimator
12. Multinomial and Ordinal Logistic Regression
13. Regression for Count Outcomes

<br />

# What to Learn Next

This course only covers the theory of statistics and econometrics. However, theory is not enough - you need to be able to apply the theory in ways that make sense for your research.

The following courses on applied econometrics/statistics will provide the necessary skills to implement the theory into actual research.

-   [Applied Econometrics: Causal Inference](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal)
-   [Applied Statistics: Multivariate Methods](https://politicalscience.github.io/multivariate)
-   [Applied Statistics: Prediction and Forecasting](https://politicalscience.github.io/prediction)
-   [Applied Statistics: Quantitative Text Analysis](https://politicalscience.github.io/text)
