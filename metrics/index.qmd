# Overview

This is a course on econometrics for social scientists. This course will introduce how to analyse real-world data to evaluate causal hypotheses in the social sciences. This course is divided into 3 sections:

1.  The **Core Course Content** covers the "essential" topics needed for causal inference and testing hypotheses in the social sciences.
2.  The **Further Regression Analysis** introduces more advanced topics that may be useful, but are not essential.
3.  The **Measurement Measurement** section discusses measuring variables (especially unobserved variables), which can be useful for more advanced statistical analysis.

**Prerequisites**: I highly recommend one has a solid understanding of calculus and basic statistical theory. Specifically, I assume knowledge through the first part of the quantitative methods (for social scientists) course covering single variable calculus and introductory statistical theory.

-   This course will also provide code for implementation of methods in R. However, this course is not a course in the R-programming language.

# Core Course Content

The "essential" topics for understanding econometrics and causal inference in the social sciences.

| Chapter                                  | Overview                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1: Correlations and Basics of Regression | How to quantify relationships between variables, and the setup, estimation, and interpretation of the linear regression model.        |
| 2: Why Correlation is not Causation      | The idea of causal effects and counterfactuals, and how confounders and simultaneity mean correlation is not causation.               |
| 3: Randomisation and Hypothesis Testing  | Randomised controlled trials as the "gold standard" of causal estimates, and introduction to causal inference and hypothesis testing. |
| 4: Regression to Control for Confounders | Leaving the experimental ideal, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of regression for causal inference in observational settings. |
| 5: Subclassification and Matching        | Subclassification and matching as alternatives to regression for controlling confounders, and their weaknesses and strengths.         |
| 6: Instrumental Variables Estimator      | Instrumental Variables as a solution to the issues of endogeneity, non-compliance in experiments, and confounding variables.          |
| 7: Regression Discontinuity              |                                                                                                                                       |
| 8: Differences-in-Differences            |                                                                                                                                       |
| 9: Panel and Longitudinal Data           |                                                                                                                                       |
| 10: Survey Experiments                   |                                                                                                                                       |

# Further Regression Analysis

Further models and estimators that are used in more advanced situations.

| Chapter                                     | Overview                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 11: Extensions of the Linear Model          | Discusses extensions to linear regression, including transformations, interactions, R-squared and F-tests, and more. |
| 12: Logit and Maximum Likelihood Estimation | Discusses the binomial logsitic regression for probabilities, and the maximum likelihood estimation process.         |
| 13: Multinomial and Ordinal Logit Models    |                                                                                                                      |
