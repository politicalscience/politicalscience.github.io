## Overview

This is a course on econometrics for social scientists. This course will introduce how to analyse real-world data to evaluate causal hypotheses in the social sciences.

**Prerequisites**: I highly recommend one has a solid understanding of calculus and basic statistical theory. Specifically, I assume knowledge through the first part of the quantitative methods (for social scientists) course covering single variable calculus and introductory statistical theory.

-   This course will also provide code for implementation of methods in R. However, this course is not a course in the R-programming language.

## **Part I: Introduction to Causal Inference**

In this first part, we will introduce the idea of causality, and explore the "gold standard" of causal inference: randomisation.

1.  [Causality and Counterfactuals](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/1/1.html)
2.  [Randomised Controlled Experiments](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/1/2.html)

## Part II: Correlations in Observational Data

In this part, we will start exploring ways to measure relationships between variables. [This section is not about causation]{.underline}!

3.  [Simple Linear Regression](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/2/3.html)
4.  [Multiple Linear Regression](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/2/4.html)
5.  Extensions of the Linear Model
6.  Logistic Model and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
7.  Multinomial and Ordinal Logistic Models
8.  Regression for Counts

## Part III: Causality in Observational Studies

In this part, we go from the correlation of regression and try to reach causal conclusions while dealing with observational data.

9.  Regression in Causal Settings
10. Selection on Observables Designs
11. Instrumental Variables Estimator
12. Extensions of Instrumental Variables
13. Panel and Longitudinal Data
14. Differences-in-Differences
15. Regression Discontinuity
16. Survey Experimental Design

## Part IV: Measurement of Variables

In this part, we discuss ways to measure variables that are not inherently measurable, in order to use them for statistical analysis.

17. Exploratory Factor Analysis
18. Confirmatory Factor Analysis
19. Latent Trait Models
20. Latent Class Models
21. Cluster Analysis
22. Structural Equation Modelling

## Part V: Advanced Topics

In this part, we discuss advanced estimators and topics that are not essential in econometrics.

23. Logit Models and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
24. Multinomial and Ordinal Logistic Models
25. Regression for Counts
26. Principle Components Analysis
