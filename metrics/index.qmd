# Overview

This is a full course on econometrics for social scientists. This course will introduce how to analyse real-world data to come to conclusions. This course is divided into the following parts:

-   Part I: Statistical Relationships and Linear Regression
-   Part II: Econometrics and Causal Inference
-   Part III: Further Econometric Models
-   Part III: Multivariate Measurement and Analysis

**Prerequisites**: I highly recommend one has a solid understanding of calculus and basic statistical theory. Specifically, I assume knowledge through the first part of the quantitative methods (for social scientists) course covering single variable calculus and introductory statistical theory.

-   This course will also provide code for implementation of methods in R. However, this course is not a course in the R-programming language.

# Part I: Statistical Relationships and Linear Regression

Before we can start any of the fancy econometric/statistical methods for causal inference/prediction, we must first understand the basics: how to quantify relationships between variables.

This part introduces the fundamental concepts of regression and hypothesis testing, and its key components, which are a prerequisite for any other part of this course.

| 2: Introduction to Statistical Inference and Hypothesis Testing | Introduces the concepts of sampling and populations, standard errors, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests.                                                            |
| 3: Extensions to the Linear Regression Model                    | Discusses extensions to the linear model, including categorical explanatory variables, polynomial and logarithmic transformations, and interaction effects.                  |

# Part II: Econometrics and Causal Inference

In the social sciences, we often care about causality. How does $x$ policy effect $y$ outcome? How do $x$ characteristics cause individual outcomes $y$? These are all causal based questions.

Up to this point, we have discussed statistical relationships and correlation. However, **correlation is not causation**. This part is focused on disentangling correlation from causation to estimate causal effects.
