# Overview

This is a full course on econometrics for social scientists. This course will introduce how to analyse real-world data to come to conclusions. Topics include estimating causal effects, causal inference, forecasting & prediction, as well as measurement problems.

This course is divided into 3 main parts, each which focus on a major topic in econometrics. It is recommended that you start in order.

**Prerequisites**: There are no formal prerequisites - i.e. anyone can learn about econometric methods.

-   However, without a solid mathematical background, the details may be hard to pick up.

-   I highly recommend one has a solid understanding of calculus and basic statistical theory. Specifically, I assume knowledge through the first part of the quantitative methods (for social scientists) course covering single variable calculus and introductory statistical theory.

This course will also provide code for implementation of methods in R. I will also provide some notes on STATA, however, this is not the focus of this course (since STATA is costly and not everyone has access to it, while R is free).

-   However, this course is not a course in the R-programming language. I assume a basic understanding of variables, functions, data frames, and packages.
