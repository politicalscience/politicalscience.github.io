### Welcome to the Political Science Academy

This is a collection of materials and information on political science topics and methods that I have compiled over my years of studying political science. The goal of this webpage is to have a single centre for political science resources for political science students. This guide consists of 7 courses, each covering a different topic in political science methodology.

# **THIS PAGE IS IN BETA - I WILL BE UPDATING THIS CONSTANTLY THROUGHOUT 2024-2025 SCHOOL YEAR. A LOT OF CONTENT IS MISSING.**

# Statistics II: Causal Inference and Research Design {#statistics2}

*In political science, we are primarily interested in causal relationships. For example, how do different voting systems cause different amounts of women representation in parliament?

# Machine Learning I: Prediction Methods {#machine1}

*Sometimes in political science, we are more concerned with prediction accuracy, rather than causality or explain-ability. For example, a major area of predictive political science research is in predicting civil wars. The traditionally OLS regression and Logistic regression, while good for finding relationships and easy to interpret, often lack in accuracy compared to more modern machine learning methods.*

*This course is a rigorous introduction to machine learning prediction methods that have been adopted in the social sciences. This course focuses on supervised learning, but includes a few topics of unsupervised learning.*

*This course will utilise the R language. We will be using the Tidyverse package extensively. Other packages will be used for specific topics.*

# Machine Learning II: Text Analysis {#machine2}

*A lot of modern political data takes the form of text: constitutions, political manifestos, political platforms, and political speeches. Traditionally, it has been difficult to turn these textual data sources into quantitative data that we can make broad conclusions on. However, with the development of quantitative text analysis methods in machine learning, we can now analyse textual data on a large scale relatively efficiently.*

*This course is a rigorous introduction to the machine learning field of quantitative text analysis, allowing us to quantify texts and documents to better understand textual data.*

*This course will utilise the R language. We will be using two packages extensively: Tidyverse and Quanteda.*

# Game Theory and Formal Modelling {#games}

*Game Theory is a branch of mathematics, originally created to solve games like Chess. However, social scientists began noticing that games - or instances involving strategic interaction - were all over the social sciences. For example, competition in an oligopoly, competition of political parties, competition between world superpowers, are all examples of strategic interaction. Game Theory models these strategic interactions assuming individuals act rationally, which allows us to see model outcomes of strategic competition, and also identify when actors do not act rationally.*

*This course introduces Game Theory (Formal Modelling), and how these mathematical models can contribute to political science research.*

    -   Examples of Game Theory, Preferences, Definitions.

# R Fundamentals for Political Science Methods {#r}

*R is a programming language that is commonly used for statistics and data science, particularly in academia. As you will probably have noticed, many of the courses in this website utilise R. This section will have some R guides on some fundamental techniques needed for the other courses.*

*This course is not meant to be a complete and full introduction to R. It is best to view this course as a reference guide after you have the basics of R down. [Resources for learning R](#resources).*

# Topics in Mathematics for Political Science {#maths}

*While most political scientists will not need to be math wizards, it is useful to have a baseline understanding of some math to help with the statistics and data science approaches commonly used in political science.*

# Further Information

#### About the Creator {#creator}

This handbook was created by Kevin Lingfeng Li, in R-Markdown!

-   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlingfengli/) \| [Personal Website](https://kevinli03.github.io)

I completed my undergraduate in BSc Politics at King's College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. I then went on to pursue a MSc in Political Science & Political Economy at the London School of Economics (LSE).

I created this handbook as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that I had learned a ton of methods, but could not remember the syntax for all of them. Online resources often over-complicated the functions needed for political science analysis. Thus, in my free time, I created this handbook as a quick guide to implementing common statistical techniques.

I do my best to update this handbook: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.

-   For those who need an introduction to statistics, I recommend the **Khan Academy** course on AP Stats for a mathematical introduction: <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics>

-   There is also a terrific free textbook on **Statistical learning with applications to R**: <https://www.statlearning.com>

-   **BurkeyAcademy** provides free online econometrics courses and implementations in R: <https://www.burkeyacademy.com/statistics-econometrics>

-   For more advanced individuals who want to learn more in-depth about statistics, see this excellent **MIT lecture series**: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61ATaGTFcSp7bhogloD2wHP>

-   A free resource to learn R with is **CodeAcademy**: <https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-r>

-   For those who have spare cash to spend, there is an excellent R programming course **(Data Analysis with R) offered by IBM on Coursera**, which teaches R and statistics: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-r>

-   I also highly recommend those who can afford it, to attend the **London School of Economic (LSE) Summer School**, which has an excellent course - **ME314 Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning**. Many of these methods are covered in depth in this course, and the course is run by one of the developers of Quanteda, the main textual-analysis R package.
