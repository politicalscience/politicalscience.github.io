# Causal Identification

**IN PROGRESS - WILL BE RE-MADE!**

In the last chapter, we introduced the frameworks of causal inference, and how randomisation can establish causality.

However, in the social sciences, we cannot always run randomised experiments where we control the assignment of treatment. In fact, in most scenarios, we have to rely on observational data. In this chapter, we introduce methods to identify causal effects when randomisation is not possible.

<br />

## Selection on Observables

Randomisation is not always feasible. Selection on Observables is an alternative way to get rid of the selection bias problem by [controlling for a set of confounders](causal.qmd#confounders) $\mathcal X$ to [block backdoor paths](causal.qmd#structural-causal-models) and isolate the relationship between $D \rightarrow Y$.

## Good and Bad Controls

Good controls are confounders $X$ who cause $D$ (i.e. $X \rightarrow D$), and cause/caused by $Y$. They must be linked to both $D$ and $Y$.

Bad controls are any variable $W$ that is caused by $D$, i.e. $D \rightarrow W$. We do not need to control for this because $W$ isn't causing selection into $D$, it is actually itself caused by $D$.

Another bad control is a variable $Z$ that only causes $D$, and not $Y$. This reduces the variation in $D$ (since we are now only using the part of $D$ caused by $Y$), which may amplify any other confounders unaccounted for.

Neutral controls are variables that only cause $Y$ and are not associated with $D$. They do not affect the causal identification, but can reduce our standard errors of our estimates.
:::

We will have controlled for the correct amount of confounders in set $\mathcal X$, when we have eliminated all variables causing selection bias, and we meet the following assumptions:

::: {#def-selectiononobservables style="border-style: solid; border-radius: 8px; border-width: 0.5px; padding-top: 5px;   padding-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 5px;"}
## Selection on Observables

There are 2 assumptions needed to identify causal effects in the selections on observables framework.

**Conditional Ignorability** (also called conditional independence) means that among units $i$ with identical confounder values $\mathcal X_i$, treatment $D_i$ is as-if randomly assigned. Potential outcomes are independent from treatment within each specific confounder value $\mathcal X_i = x$.

$$
(Y_{0i}, Y_{1i}) \ind D_i \ | \ \mathcal X_i = x, \ \forall \ x \in \mathcal X
$$

This assumption implies that given any value of confounders $\mathcal X_i = x$, potential outcomes are equivalent between treatment and control groups:

$$
\begin{align}
& \E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 1, \mathcal X_i = x) \ = \ \E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0, \mathcal X_i = x) \ = \ \E(Y_{0i}|\mathcal X_i = x) \\
& \E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1, \mathcal X_i = x) \ = \ \E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 0, \mathcal X_i = x) \ = \ \E(Y_{1i}|\mathcal X_i = x)
\end{align}
$$

**Common Support** is the second assumption, and it states for any unit $i$ with any value of $\mathcal X_i$, they have a non-zero probability they can be assigned to both control and treatment.
:::

How do these assumptions help us identify and measure the causal effect? Well, let us first start with the CATE from @def-cate:

$$
\begin{align}
\tau_{CATE}(x) & = \E(Y_{1i} - Y_{0i} \ | \ \mathcal X_i = x) \\
& = \E(Y_{1i} | \mathcal X_i = x) - \E(Y_{0i}|\mathcal X_i = x) \\
\end{align}
$$

Now, from the properties implied by conditional ignorability given in @def-selectiononobservables, we get

$$
\begin{align}
\tau_{CATE}(x) & = \E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1, \mathcal X_i = x) - \E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0, \mathcal X_i = x) \\
& = \E(Y_{i}|D_i = 1, \mathcal X_i = x) - \E(Y_{i}|D_i = 0, \mathcal X_i = x) \\
\end{align}
$$

And the second step above is because $Y_{1i}|D_i = 1$ and $Y_{0i}|D_i = 0$ are observable outcomes. Thus, with independence, we can identify the CATE with just observed outcomes.

Now, let us consider the ATE, which is $\E(Y_{1i} - Y_{0i})$. From the definition of a continuous random variable's expectation given in @def-exp, we can rewrite the ATE as

$$
\tau_{ATE} = \int\tau_{CATE}(x) \P(\mathcal x) dy
$$

Which is a weighted average. We established in @eq-soocate that we can identify the CATE. Thus, we can plug @eq-soocate into the ATE to get our identified ATE:

$$
\tau_{ATE} = \int [\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 1, \mathcal X_i = x) - \E(Y_{i}|D_i = 0, \mathcal X_i = x)] \P(x) dy
$$

And all the values in this equation are observed outcomes $Y_i$, meaning if we control for set of confounders $\mathcal X$, our correlation becomes a causal effect.

We can also do a very similar proof for identifying the ATT. The conditional-ATT is equal to the CATE based on the assumption of conditional ignorability. Using the definition of the ATT from @def-att and the definition of expectation given in @def-exp, we see the ATT equals:

$$
\begin{align}
\tau_{ATT} & = \int \tau_{CATE}(x) \P(x|D_i = 1) dy \\
& = \int [\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 1, \mathcal X_i = x) - \E(Y_{i}|D_i = 0, \mathcal X_i = x)] \P(x|D_i = 1) dy
\end{align}
$$

And all the $Y_i$ here are observed, meaning we can identify the ATT.

Assuming we meet the assumptions given in @def-selectiononobservables, there are multiple estimators, including regression, matching, and weighting, which we will discuss in more detail in the chapter on causal estimation.

## Instruments and Non-Compliance

When we assign individuals to treatment/control in randomised experiments, we often cannot guarantee that individuals will actually follow through with treatment. Sometimes, someone who was supposed to get treatment refuses treatment, and sometimes, someone who shouldn't get the treatment decides to get treatment.

We can formalise this idea. Let us assume an **encouragement** $Z_i \in \{0, 1\}$, which is our treatment assignment. Then, we have the **treatment** variable $D_i \in \{0,1\}$, which is someone who actually took the treatment or not. Given this framework, we can divide all units $i$ into 4 categories:

1.  Compliers: People who comply with encouragement $Z_i$. Their $Z_i = D_i$.
2.  Always-takers: People who no matter what encouragement $Z_i$ is, always take treatment.
3.  Never-takers: People who no matter their encouragement $Z_i$ is, never take treatment.
4.  Defiers: People who do the opposite of encouragement $Z_i$, so always $D_i â‰  Z_i$.

We can show what will happen with all 4 types of people in a table, called the principal strata:

|           |                       |                      |
|-----------|-----------------------|----------------------|
|           | $Z_i = 1$             | $Z_i = 0$            |
| $D_i = 1$ | Complier/Always-Taker | Defier/Always-Taker  |
| $D_i = 0$ | Defier/Never-Taker    | Complier/Never-Taker |

The idea of the non-compliance designs is to use our encouragement/treatment assignment $Z$ as an instrument for $D$ - actually taking the treatment. This can solve any concerns we might have regarding selection into non-compliance.

One causal estimand that we can estimate is the **Intent To Treat (ITT)**, which is essentially the ATE of $Z$ on $Y$, ignoring if people actually took the treatment or not. This is essentially the affect of encouragement. If there is any non-compliance, then the ITT will not equal the ATE.

$$
\tau_{ITT} = \E(Y_i|Z_i = 1) - \E(Y_i | Z_i = 0)
$$

This is quite easily estimatable in non-compliance randomisation settings, since $Z$ is randomly assigned. Thus, we can calculate the ITT with a linear regression:

$$
Y_i = \alpha + \tau_{ITT} Z_i + \eps_i
$$

However, we might not care about the ITT. We might want the actual effect of $D$ on $Y$. An alternative is to find the Average Treatment Effect on only compliers, called the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) (a version of the CATE from @def-cate). We need a few assumptions:

::: {#def-ivassumptions style="border-style: solid; border-radius: 8px; border-width: 0.5px; padding-top: 5px;   padding-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 5px;"}
## Instrumental Variables Assumptions

There are 4 assumptions for us to identify the LATE. The first 3 are the normal assumptions from the IV estimator.

1.  **Relevance**: $Z$ must be correlated to $D$. Or in other words, compilers must exist, or else, encouragement would not affect treatment.
2.  **Ignorability/Exogneity**: There is no backdoor path between $Z$ and $D$, and no backdoor path between $Z$ and $Y$ (we can do controls/selection on observables to account for this).
3.  **Exclusions Restriction**: $Z$ must only have an effect on $Y$ through $D$. $Z$ must not have any independent effect on $Y$.
4.  **Monotonicity**: There are no defiers.

## Visual Examples of Violations

The figure below contains some visual examples of violations of the above to faciliate understanding of these assumptions:

![](images/clipboard-390858332.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}
:::

Let us show how we can prove the LATE is identifiable under these assumptions. First, the ITT itself in @eq-itt is identifiable under exogeneity/ignorability alone. Now, let us define $c$ as compliers, $a$ as always-takers, $n$ as never-takers, and $d$ as defiers. We can break down the ITT into a weighted average:

$$
\tau_{ITT} = \tau_{ITT}^c \P(c) + \tau_{ITT}^a \P(a) + \tau_{ITT}^n \P(n) + \tau_{ITT}^d \P(d)
$$

We know that under our assumption of monotonicity, we assume no defiers, so $\P(d) = 0$:

$$
\tau_{ITT} = \tau_{ITT}^c \P(c) + \tau_{ITT}^a \P(a) + \tau_{ITT}^n \P(n) 
$$

Our exclusions restriction says that $Z$ has no affect on $Y$. Remember that the ITT from @eq-itt is the relationship between $Z$ and $Y$. But since always-takers and never-takers ignore $Z$ when deciding treatment, $Z$ has no effect of them on $Y$. Thus, we can further simplify:

$$
\tau_{ITT} = \tau_{ITT}^c \P(c)
$$

Remember that the $\tau_{ITT}$ for compliers, $\tau_{ITT}^c$, is our LATE that we want to identify. So, let us isolate it to get:

$$
\tau_{LATE} = \frac{\tau_{ITT}}{\P(c)} \ = \ \frac{\E(Y_i | Z_i = 1) - \E(Y_i | Z_i = 0)}{\E(D_i | Z_i = 1) - \E(D_i | Z_i = 0)}
$$

The LATE is interpreted as the ATE of the compliers. This can be tricky to interpret sometimes, as you cannot actually identify who the compliers are, and different encouragements $Z$ can result in different compliers.

The LATE is also generally not equal to the ATE or ATT without further assumptions. When there is only one-sided non-compliance when people who are not encouraged cannot get the treatment, the LATE does equal the ATT.
