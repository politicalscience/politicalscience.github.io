This chapter introduces some key theory regarding the ordinary least squares estimator, that will inform the conditions and assumptions we will need to make in order to achieve unbiased causal estimation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **Ordinary Least Squares Estimator**

### Deriving the Estimator

To estimate the population parameters $\beta_0, \dots, \beta_k$, we use our sample data, and try to find the values $\widehat{\beta_0}, \dots, \widehat{\beta_k}$ that **minimise the square sum of residuals** (SSR):

$$
\begin{split}
SSR & = (\mathbf y - \mathbf{\hat y})^T(\mathbf y - \mathbf{\hat y}) \\
& = (\mathbf y - \mathbf{Xb})^T(\mathbf y - \mathbf{Xb})
\end{split}
$$

Let us define our estimation vector $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}$ as the value of $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}$ that minimises the sum of squared errors:

$$
\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}} = \min\limits_{b} (\mathbf y - \mathbf{Xb})^T (\mathbf y - \mathbf{Xb}) = \min\limits_b S(\mathbf b)
$$

We can expand $S(\mathbf b)$ as follows:

$$
\begin{split}
S(\mathbf b) & = \mathbf y^T \mathbf y - \mathbf b^T \mathbf X^T \mathbf y - \mathbf y^T \mathbf{Xb} + \mathbf b^T \mathbf X^T \mathbf{Xb} \\ 
& = \mathbf y^T \mathbf y - 2\mathbf b^T \mathbf X^T \mathbf y + \mathbf b^T \mathbf X^T \mathbf{Xb}
\end{split}
$$

Taking the partial derivative in respect to $b$:

$$
\frac{\partial S(\mathbf b)}{\partial \mathbf b} = \begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial S(\mathbf b)}{\partial b_1} \\\vdots \\\frac{\partial S(\mathbf b)}{\partial b_k}\end{pmatrix}
$$

Differentiating with the vector $b$ yields:

$$
\frac{\partial S(\mathbf b)}{\partial b} = -2\mathbf X^T \mathbf y + 2 \mathbf X^T \mathbf{Xb}
$$

Evaluated at $\hat{\beta}$, the derivatives should equal zero (since first order condition of finding minimums):

$$
\frac{\partial S(\mathbf b)}{\partial b} \biggr|_{\hat{\beta}} = -2\mathbf X^T \mathbf y + 2\mathbf X^T \mathbf X \boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}} = 0
$$

When assuming $\mathbf X^T \mathbf X$ is invertable (which is true if $\mathbf X$ is full rank), we can isolate $\hat{\beta}$ to find the solution to OLS:

$$
\begin{split}
-2\mathbf X^T\mathbf y + 2 \mathbf X^T \mathbf X \boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}} & = 0 \\
2 \mathbf X^T \mathbf X \boldsymbol{\hat\beta} & = 2\mathbf X^T \mathbf y \\
\boldsymbol{\hat\beta} & = (2\mathbf X^T \mathbf X)^{-1} 2 \mathbf X^T \mathbf y \\
\boldsymbol{\hat\beta} & = (\mathbf X^T \mathbf X)^{-1} \mathbf X^T \mathbf y
\end{split}
$$

<br />

### Regression Anatomy Theorem

Regression Anaotmy Theorem allows us to interpret our OLS estimates $\hat\beta_j$ as the effect $x_j \rightarrow y$, when partialling out the effects of other regressions $x_1, \dots, x_k â‰  x_j$.

Take our standard multiple linear regression:

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + ... + \beta_k x_{ki} + u_i
$$

Let us say we are interested in $x_1$ (this can be generalised to any explanatory variable $x_j$). Let us make $x_1$ the outcome variable of a regression with explanatory variables $x_2, ..., x_k$:

$$
x_{1i} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 x_{2i} + ... + \gamma_{k-1}x_{ki} + \widetilde{r_{1i}}
$$

The error term is $\widetilde{r_{1i}}$, which represents the part of $x_{1i}$ that are uncorrelated to $x_2, ..., x_k$. In other words, $\widetilde{r_{1i}}$ is the part of $x_1$ that cannot be explained by any other explanatory variable $x_2, ..., x_k$. (uncorrelated with them)

<br />

Now, take the regression of with outcome variable $y$, with all explanatory variables [except]{.underline} $x_1$:

$$
y_i = \delta_0 + \delta_1 x_{2i} + ... + \delta_{k-1} x_{ki} + \widetilde{y_i}
$$

The error term is $\widetilde{y_i}$, which is the part of $y_i$ that cannot be explained by $x_2, ..., x_k$ (uncorrelated with them). Since $\widetilde{y_i}$ is not explained by $x_2, ..., x_k$, variable $x_1$ must be the one explaining $\widetilde{y_i}$.

-   But, it is not the whole of $x_1$ explaining $\tilde{y_i}$. This is since $x_1$ may also correlated with $x_2, ..., x_k$, and the correlated parts of $x_1$ with $x_2, ..., x_k$ are already picked up in the regression by the coefficients of $x_2, ..., x_k$.

Thus, $\widetilde{y_i}$ must be explained by the part of $x_1$ that is uncorrelated and not explained by $x_2, ..., x_k$, which we derived earlier as $\widetilde{r_{1i}}$.

<br />

Thus, we can create another regression with explanatory variable $\widetilde{x_{1i}}$ and outcome variable $\widetilde{y_i}$.

$$
\widetilde{y_i} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \widetilde{r_{1i}} + u_i
$$

We can plug $\widetilde{y_i}$ back into our regression of $y_i$ with explanatory variables $x_2 ..., x_k$, and re-arrange:

$$
\begin{split}
y_i & = \delta_0 + \delta_1 x_{2i} + ... + \delta_{k-1} x_{ki} + \widetilde{y_i} \\
y_i & = \delta_0 + \delta_1 x_{2i} + ... + \delta_{k-1} x_{ki} + \underbrace{\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \widetilde{r_{1i}} + u_i}_{\text{plug in } \widetilde{y_i}} \\
y_i  & = \underbrace{(\delta_0 + \alpha_0)}_{\beta_0} + \underbrace{\alpha_1 \widetilde{r_{1i}}}_{\beta_1 x_{1i}} + \underbrace{\delta_1x_{2i}}_{\beta_2 x_{2i}} + ... + \underbrace{\delta_{k-1} x_{ki}}_{\beta_kx_{ki}} + \underbrace{u_i}_{u_i} 
\end{split}
$$

As we can see, this new regression mirrors the original standard multiple linear regression:

Importantly we know the $\beta_1 x_{1i}$ in the original is analogous to $\alpha_1 \widetilde{r_{1i}}$. Thus, [the estimate of $\alpha_1$ will be the same as $\beta_1$ in the original regression]{.underline}.

The coefficient $\alpha_1$ (which is equal to $\beta_1$) explains the expected change in $y$, given an increase in the part of $x_1$ uncorrelated with $x_2, ..., x_k$.

So essentially, [we have **partialed out** the effect of the other explanatory variables, and only focus on the effect on $y$ of the uncorrelated part of $x_1$ (which is $\widetilde{r_{1i}}$)]{.underline}

# **OLS as an Unbiased Estimator**

### Unbiased Estimators

An estimator is unbiased, if its estimates $\hat\theta_n$ are of the following:

$$
E(\hat\theta_n) = \theta
$$

Or in other words, if we repeatedly sample and use the estimator, on average, the estimates will be equal to the true population value.

We want an estimator that is unbiased. Why?

-   We know that the expectation of a random variable is its "best guess" of its value.
-   We know that estimates $\hat\theta_n$ from an estimator are a random variable called the sampling distribution.
-   Thus, if $E(\hat\theta_n) = \theta$, that means our "best guess" of the estimator value is the true parameter value $\theta$. That means any one estimate $\hat\theta_n$ is on average, correct.

<br />

### Conditions for Unbiasedness

OLS is an unbiased estimator of the relationship between any $x_j$ and $y$ under 4 conditions:

1.  **Linearity** in parameters: the model of the population (data generating process) can be modelled as:

$$
\mathbf y = \mathbf X \boldsymbol\beta + \mathbf u
$$

2.  **Random Sampling**: the observations in our sample are randomly sampled from the same population.
3.  **No Perfect Multicolinearity**: There is no exact linear relationships between the regressors. This ensures that $\mathbf X^T \mathbf X$ is invertible, which is required for the derivation of OLS.
4.  **Zero Conditional Mean**: $E(u|\mathbf X) = 0$. This implies that no regressor, and no function of multiple regressors is correlated with the error term.

If any of these conditions are violated, OLS is not an unbiased estimator.

<br />

### Proof of Unbiasedness

We need condition 3 to ensure $\mathbf X^T \mathbf X$ is invertible, in order to have OLS estimates. Once we have OLS estimates (derivation above), we can manipulate it as following:

$$
\begin{split}
\boldsymbol{\hat\beta} & = (\mathbf X^T \mathbf X)^{-1} \mathbf X^T \mathbf y \\
& = (\mathbf X^T \mathbf X)^{-1} \mathbf X^T\underbrace{(\mathbf X \boldsymbol\beta + \mathbf u)}_{\text{plug in } \mathbf y} \\
& = \underbrace{(\mathbf X^T \mathbf X)^{-1} \mathbf X^T \mathbf X}_{\text{inverses cancel out }} \boldsymbol\beta + (\mathbf X^T \mathbf X)^{-1} \mathbf X^T \mathbf u \\
& = \boldsymbol\beta + (\mathbf X^T \mathbf X)^{-1} \mathbf X^T \mathbf u \\
\end{split}
$$

Now, let us take the expectation of $\boldsymbol{\hat\beta}$ conditional on $\mathbf X$. Remember condition 4 - zero conditional mean, which allows us to simplify this.

$$
\begin{split}
E(\boldsymbol{\hat\beta}|\mathbf X) & = \boldsymbol\beta + (\mathbf X^T \mathbf X)^{-1} \underbrace{E(\mathbf u | \mathbf X)}_{= \ 0} \\
E(\boldsymbol{\hat\beta}|\mathbf X) & = \boldsymbol\beta
\end{split}
$$

Now, we can use the law of iterated expectations to conclude this proof:

$$
\begin{split}
E(\boldsymbol{\hat\beta}) & = E(E(\boldsymbol{\hat\beta}|\mathbf X)) \\
 & = E(\boldsymbol\beta) \\
& = \boldsymbol\beta
\end{split}
$$

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Law of Iterated Expectations

The law of iterated expectations states that:

$$
E(X) = E(E(X|Y))
$$
:::

Thus, OLS is unbiased under the 4 conditions above.

# **OLS as a Consistent Estimator**

### Asymptotically Consistent Estimators

Asymptotic properties are properties of estimators as the sample size becomes larger and larger. Or more mathematically, as the sample size $n$ approaches infinity.

An estimator is consistent, if as we increase sample size towards infinity, the estimate will become more and more concentrated around the true population value $\theta$.

Or in other words, as sample size increases indefinitely, we will get closer and closer to the true population value $\theta$, until at infinite sample size, all our estimates will be exactly $\theta$. Mathematically:

$$
Pr(|\hat\theta_n - \theta|> \epsilon) \rightarrow 0, \text { as } n \rightarrow âˆž
$$

-   Or in other words, the proabability that the distance between an estimate $\hat\theta_n$ and the true population value $\theta$ will be higher than a small close-to-zero value $\epsilon$ will be 0, since our estimates $\hat\theta_n$ will converge at the $\theta$.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Biased but Consistent

An estimator can be both biased, but consistent.

-   i.e. in smaller sample sizes, the estimator might not be on average correct, but over a large enough sample size, it will become "unbiased".

For example, in the figure below, we can see that this estimator is biased at small values of $n$, but as $n$ increases, it becomes more consistent, collapsing its distribution around the true $\theta$.

![](images/clipboard-1215503621.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Law of Large Numbers and Consistency

The law of large numbers states that the sample average of a random sample, is a consistent estimator of the population mean.

For example, let us say we have a random variable $x$. We take a random sample of $n$ units, so our sample is $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$.

-   Let us define $\bar x_n$ as our sample average.
-   Let us define $\mu$ as the true population mean of variable $x$.

The law of large numbers states that:

$$
\text{plim}( \bar x_n) = \mu
$$

-   Where $\text{plim}$ states that as $n$ approaches infinity, the probability distribution of $\bar x_n$ collapses around $\mu$.

<br />

Why is this the case? This sample mean estimator is calculated simply through the formula for mean:

$$
\bar x_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i
$$

Let us define the variance of our sample of $x_1, \dots, x_n$ as $Var(x_i) = \sigma^2$. We can now find the variance of our sampling distribution of estimator $\bar x_n$:

$$
\begin{split}
Var(\bar x_n) & = Var\left( \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i \right) \\
& = \frac{1}{n^2} Var \left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i\right) \\
& = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n Var(x_i) \\
& = \frac{1}{n^2} \sigma^2 \\
& = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
\end{split}
$$

And as sample size $n$ increases to infinity, we get:

$$
\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow âˆž} Var(\bar x_n) = \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow âˆž} \frac{\sigma^2}{n} = 0
$$

Thus, the variance of our estimator $\bar x_n$ shrinks to zero, so as sample size increases to infinity $n$, the sampling distribution of estimator $\bar x_n$ collapses around the true population mean.
:::

<br />

### Conditions for Asymptotic Consistency

OLS is an asymptotically consistent estimator of the relationship between any $x_j$ and $y$ under 4 conditions. These conditions are identical to the unbiasedness conditions EXCEPT condition 4, which is weakened from the original unbiasedness condition.

1.  **Linearity** in parameters: the model of the population (data generating process) can be modelled as:

$$
\mathbf y = \mathbf X \boldsymbol\beta + \mathbf u
$$

2.  **Random Sampling**: the observations in our sample are randomly sampled from the same population.
3.  **No Perfect Multicolinearity**: There is no exact linear relationships between the regressors. This ensures that $\mathbf X^T \mathbf X$ is invertible, which is required for the derivation of OLS.
4.  **Zero Mean and Exogeneity**: $E(u_i) = 0$, and $Cov(x_i, u_i) = 0$. This means that no regressor should be correlated with the error term. This also implies $E(x_iu_i) = 0$.

If any of these conditions are violated, OLS is not a consistent estimator.

Note - even if all these conditions are met, OLS is not unbiased, just consistent. For OLS to be unbiased, it must meet the full Zero Conditional Mean assumption as discussed previously.

<br />

### Proof of Asymptotic Consistency

We need condition 3 to ensure $\mathbf X^T \mathbf X$ is invertible, in order to have OLS estimates. Once we have OLS estimates (derivation above), we can manipulate it as following:

$$
\begin{split}
\boldsymbol{\hat\beta} & = (\mathbf X^T \mathbf X)^{-1} \mathbf X^T \mathbf y \\
& = (\mathbf X^T \mathbf X)^{-1} \mathbf X^T\underbrace{(\mathbf X \boldsymbol\beta + \mathbf u)}_{\text{plug in } \mathbf y} \\
& = \underbrace{(\mathbf X^T \mathbf X)^{-1} \mathbf X^T \mathbf X}_{\text{inverses cancel out }} \boldsymbol\beta + (\mathbf X^T \mathbf X)^{-1} \mathbf X^T \mathbf u \\
& = \boldsymbol\beta + (\mathbf X^T \mathbf X)^{-1} \mathbf X^T \mathbf u \\
\end{split}
$$

We cannot apply the law of large numbers to sums. Thus, we can convert our matrices into vector notation.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Vector Notation

The following statements are true:

$$
\begin{split}
& \mathbf X^T \mathbf X = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \mathbf x_i \mathbf x_i^T \\
& \mathbf X^T \mathbf  u = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \mathbf x_i \mathbf u_i
\end{split}
$$
:::

Thus, we can simplify the above to:

$$
\begin{split}
\boldsymbol{\hat\beta} & = \boldsymbol\beta + \left( \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \mathbf x_i \mathbf x_i^T\right)^{-1} \left( \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \mathbf x_i \mathbf u \right) \\
& = \boldsymbol\beta + \underbrace{\left( \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \mathbf x_i \mathbf x_i^T\right)^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \mathbf x_i \mathbf u \right)}_{\left(\frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \text{and } \frac{1}{n} \text{ cancel out, so still equal}}
\end{split}
$$

Now, let us apply the probability limit:

$$
\text{plim} \boldsymbol{\hat\beta} = \boldsymbol\beta + \left( \text{plim} \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \mathbf x_i \mathbf x_i^T\right)^{-1} \left( \text{plim} \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \mathbf x_i \mathbf u \right)
$$

And using the law of large numbers (see above), and the zero-mean and exogeneity condition, we can simplify to:

$$
\begin{split}
\text{plim} \boldsymbol{\hat\beta} & = \boldsymbol\beta + (E(\mathbf x_i \mathbf x_i^T))^{-1}\underbrace{E(\mathbf x_i \mathbf u_i)}_{ = \ 0} \\
\text{plim} \boldsymbol{\hat\beta} & = \boldsymbol\beta
\end{split}
$$

Thus, OLS is asymptotically consistent under the 4 conditions above.

<br />

<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **Further Properties of OLS**

### OLS as a Conditional Expectation Function

A **conditional expectation function** (CEF) says that the value of $E(y)$ depends on the value of $x$. We notate a conditional expectation function as $E(y|x)$. As we noted earlier, the linear regression model can be a conditional expectation function of $E(y|x)$.

A **best linear approximation** of a conditional expectation function can take the following form:

$$
E(y_i|x_i) = b_0 + b_1x_i
$$

With parameters $b_0, b_1$ that minimise the mean squared errors (MSE).

$$
\begin{split}
MSE & = E(y_i - E(y_i|x_i))^2 \\
& = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n( y_i - E(y_i|x_i))^2
\end{split}
$$

OLS also best-approximates the conditional expectation function. Suppose we have the conditional expectation function:

$$
E(y_i|x_i) = b_0 + b_1x_i
$$

We also know that our typical regression equation is:

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + u_i
$$

We know that $E(u_i|x_i) = 0$. Let us define $u_i$ as the following:

$$
u_i = y_i - E(y_i|x_i)
$$

If the above defined $u_i$ is true, $E(u_i|x_i)$ should also be equal to 0. So, let us plug in the above $u_i$ into $E(u_i | x_i)$.

$$
\begin{split}
E(u_i|x_i) & = E(y_i - E(y_i|x_i) \ | \ x_i) \\
& = E(y_i|x_i) - E(y_i|x_i) \\
& = 0
\end{split}
$$

Thus, we know $u_i = y_i - E(y_i|x_i)$ to be true. Thus, rearranging, we know:

$$
y_i = E(y_i|x_i) + u_i
$$

We also know that $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + u_i$. Thus, the following is true:

$$
\begin{split}
E(y_i|x_i) + u_i & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + u_i \\
b_0 + b_1 + u_i & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + u_i \\
b_0 + b_1 & = \beta_0 + \beta_1
\end{split}
$$

Well, you might point out, it is still possible that $b_1 â‰  \beta_1$ in this scenario. We can go further. We know that the conditional expectation function minimises the mean of squared errors.

$$
\begin{split}
MSE & = \min\limits_{b_0, b_1} E(y_i - E(y_i|x_i))^2 \\
& = \min\limits_{b_0, b_1} E(y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1x_i)^2
\end{split}
$$

The first order conditions are (using chain rule and partial derivatives, just like in the OLS derivation):

$$
\begin{split}
& E(y_i - b_0 - b_1x_i) = 0 \\
& E(x_i(y_i - b_0 - b_1x_i) = 0
\end{split}
$$

<br />

Now, recall our OLS minimisation conditions:

$$
\begin{split}
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i) = 0 \\
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i) = 0
\end{split}
$$

Since by definition, average/expectation is $E(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum x_i$, we can rewrite the OLS minimisation conditions as:

$$
\begin{split}
& n \times E(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1x_i) = 0 \\
& n \times E(x_i(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1x_i)) = 0
\end{split}
$$

And since anything multiplied to a zero turns into zero, we can ignore the $n$ in the first order condition, and only focus on the expected value part. Thus, our conditions are:

$$
\begin{split}
& E(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1x_i) = 0 \\
& E(x_i(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1x_i)) = 0
\end{split}
$$

Which as we can see, are the exact same minimisation conditions as the conditional expectation function. Thus, OLS is the best approximation of the conditional expectation function.

This property is very useful for causal inference, as it means OLS is calculated the expected $y$, which allows us to find causal effects by comparing the expected $y$ of the treatment and control groups (assuming the OLS estimator is unbiased).

<br />

### OLS as a Method of Moments Estimator

The Method of Moments Estimator is another estimator of the true value of populations in the parameter. The estimator defines key population **moments** of interest - which are the population parameters written in terms of expected value functions set equal to 0.

Then, the Method of Moments uses the sample equivalents of the population moments to estimate the population parameter.

-   For example, to estimate the population mean, the Method of Moments uses the sample mean.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Details of the Method of Moments Estimator

In order to define a method of moments for a set of parameters $\theta_1, \dots, \theta_k$, we need to specify at least one population moment per parameter. Or in other words, we must have more than $k$ population moments.

Our population moments can be defined as the expected value of some function $m(\theta; y)$ that consists of both the variable $y$ and our unknown parameter $\theta$. The expectation of the function $m(\theta; y)$ should equal 0.

$$
E(m(\theta; y)) = 0
$$

Our sample moments will be the sample analogues of $\theta$ and $y$, which are $\hat\theta$ and $y_i$:

$$
\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n m(\hat\theta; y_i) = 0
$$

-   The $\frac{1}{n} \sum$ is there because the definition of expectation/mean is that.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Example of the Method of Moments Estimator

Let us say that we have some random variable $y$, with a true population mean $\mu$. We want to estimate $\mu$, but we only have a sample of the population.

How can we define our true population parameter $\mu$ in an expectation equation of the form: $E(m(\mu, y)) = 0$?

-   Well, what is $\mu$, the mean, intuitively speaking? It is the expectation of $y$, so $\mu = E(y)$.

Now that we know that $\mu = E(y)$, since they are equal, $\mu - E(y) = 0$. Thus, we can define the mean as a moment of the following condition:

$$
E(y - \mu) = 0
$$

The method of moments says we should use the sample equivalent of the population parameter. The sample equivalent of $\mu$ (the true mean of the population), is of course, the sample mean $\bar y$.

Thus, our sample estimate of the moment would be:

$$
E(y_i - \hat\mu) = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat\mu) = 0
$$

With this equation, we can then solve for $\hat\mu$:

$$
\begin{split}
0 & = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat\mu) \\
0 & = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^ny_i - \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \hat\mu \\
0 & = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^ny_i - \frac{1}{n} n \hat\mu\\
0 & = \bar y - \hat \mu \\
\hat\mu & = \bar y
\end{split}
$$

So, we see the method of moments estimates our true population mean $\mu$, with the sample mean $\bar y$.
:::

OLS is a special case of the Method of Moments Estimator. This property is useful as the Instrumental Variables Design is built on this idea.

Consider the bivariate regression model:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + u
$$

The OLS estimator can be derived as a method of moments estimator, with 2 moments (expectation functions set equal to 0), one for each parameter ($\beta_0, \beta_1$):

$$
\begin{split}
& E(y-\beta_0 -\beta_1x) = 0 \\
& E(x(y - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x)) = 0
\end{split}
$$

Since we know $u = y - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x$, we can rewrite the two moments as:

$$
\begin{split}
& E(u) = 0 \\
& E(xu) = 0
\end{split}
$$

The estimates of these moments would use the sample equivalents: $\hat\beta_0$ and $\hat\beta_1$.

$$
\begin{split}
& E(y-\hat\beta_0 -\hat\beta_1x) = 0 \\
& E(x(y - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1 x)) = 0
\end{split}
$$

<br />

Let us prove that OLS is a special case of the method of moments estimator. Remember our OLS minimisation conditions:

$$
\begin{split}
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i) = 0 \\
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i) = 0
\end{split}
$$

Since by definition, average/expectation is $E(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum x_i$, we can rewrite the OLS minimisation conditions as:

$$
\begin{split}
& n \times E(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1x_i) = 0 \\
& n \times E(x_i(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1x_i)) = 0
\end{split}
$$

And since anything multiplied to a zero turns into zero, we can ignore the $n$ in the first order condition, and only focus on the expected value part. Thus, our conditions are:

$$
\begin{split}
& E(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1x_i) = 0 \\
& E(x_i(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1x_i)) = 0
\end{split}
$$

Which as we can see, are the exact same minimisation conditions as the method of moments estimator. Thus, the OLS estimator is a special case of the Method of Moments estimator, and they produce the same coefficients.

### OLS as a Maximum Likelihood Estimator

The Maximum Likelihood Estimator is an estimation procedure that is used for Logistic Regression and Count Regression (and many other statistical concepts). Refer to the regression notes to see the details of the maximum likelihood estimator.

OLS is a special case of the maximum likelihood estimator under two conditions:

1.  The error term $u$ must be normally distributed, such that $n \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma^2)$.
2.  We assume homoscedasticity: $Var(u|x) = \sigma^2$.

A normal distribution has the following probability density function:

$$
f(y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}}e^{\left( \frac{(x- \mu)^2}{2 -\sigma^2}\right)}
$$

Assuming our error term is normally distributed, we know that the conditional probability density function of our linear model $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + u_i$ is as follows:

$$
f(y_i|x_i;\beta_0, \beta_1, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}}
 e^{ \left( -\frac{1}{2 \sigma^2}(y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2 \right)}$$

By the independence of $y_1, \dots, y_n$, the likelihood function is:

$$
\begin{split}
L & = \prod_{i=1}^nf(y_i|x_i; \beta_0, \beta_1, \sigma^2) \\
& =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}}
 e^{ \left( -\frac{1}{2 \sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2 \right)}
\end{split}
$$

The log-likelihood function is thus:

$$
\log L = -\frac{n}{2} \log (2 \pi) - \frac{n}{2} \log (\sigma^2) -\frac{1}{2 \sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2
$$

We can maximise the log-likelihood function (and thus the likelihood function) by finding the first order conditions:

$$
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial \log L}{\partial\beta_0} : & \ -\frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1 x_i) \times -1 =0 \\
\frac{\partial \log L}{\partial\beta_1} : & \ -\frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1 x_i) \times -x_i =0 \\
\frac{\partial \log L}{\partial\sigma^2} : & \ -\frac{n}{2\sigma^2}  + \frac{1}{2\sigma^4} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1 x_i) =0 \\
\end{split}
$$

We can focus on the first two conditions, since we are interested in the intercept $\beta_0$ and coefficient $\beta_1$ estimates. We can ignore the initial $\frac{1}{\sigma^2}$, since if the summation equals zero, the whole partial derivative will also equal zero.

Thus, our first order conditions for maximum likelihood estimation are:

$$
\begin{split}
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1 x_i) = 0 \\
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1 x_i)x_i = 0
\end{split}
$$

These conditions are identical to our OLS conditions. Thus, the maximum likelihood estimator is equivalent to OLS given normality of the error term and homoscedasticity.
