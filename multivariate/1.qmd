# **Basics**

### Principle Components Analysis

Principle Components Analysis (PCA) combines multiple observed variables into one or new observed variables.

We might not be interested in these separate variables $X_1, X_2, X_3$, but instead, want to use the together to measure something. Thus, we summarise them into one (or more) variables $Y_1$.

## Example: Trust in Institutions

A survey asked respondents to respond, on a scale of 0-10, how much they trust the institutions.

-   Parliament
-   Legal
-   Police
-   Politicians
-   Political Parties
-   European Parliament
-   United Nations

We don't care about each variable individually. We want to summarise them into one variable that describes trust in institutions.

We can use PCA to create $y_1$ (and $y_2$, and more).
