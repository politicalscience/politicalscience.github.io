## Introduction

This site is a guide to quantitative political science, primarily focusing on a mathematical/formal modelling approach (often called Political Economics).

A companion to this guide is the [Statistics for Social Scientists Guide](https://statsnotes.github.io), which provides the statistical and econometric methods (as well as mathematics in the appendix) that help test the models and theories developed in this guide.

<br />

## Part I: Political Game Theory

*This part introduces the key concepts of Game Theory and modelling in Political Science, and applies them to a few simple games.*

-   1.1: Preferences, Utility Functions, and Basics of Games
-   1.2: Dominant Strategy Equilibrium and the Prisoner's Dilemma
-   1.3: Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium
-   1.4: Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium
-   1.5: Median Voter Theory and Spatial Models
-   1.6: Further Spatial Models
-   1.7: Dynamic Games and Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
-   1.8: Repeated Games and Cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemma
-   1.9: Imperfect and Incomplete Information
-   1.10: Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium
-   1.11: Signalling Games and Applications

<br />

## Part II: Democratic Elections and Institutions

*This part takes the concepts discussed in Part I, and applies it to the study of democratic institutions, such as elections, media, and political parties.*

<br />

## Part III: Autocratic Politics and Democratisation

*This part takes the concepts in Part I, and applies it to the study of non-democratic states and democratisation*.

<br />

## Part IV: Behavioural Political Economy

*This part takes the concepts discussed in Part I and applies them to understanding the decisions of politicians, candidates, policy makers, and other political actors.*
