## Introduction

This site is a guide to quantitative political science, primarily focusing on a mathematical/formal modelling approach (often called Political Economics).

A companion to this guide is the [Statistics for Social Scientists Guide](https://statsnotes.github.io), which provides the statistical and econometric methods (as well as mathematics in the appendix) that help test the models and theories developed in this guide.

<br />

## Part I: Political Game Theory

*This part introduces the key concepts of Game Theory and formal modelling in Political Science, and applies them to a few examples.*

Pre-requisites: Understanding of single variable calculus and basic probability theory (up to Bayes' rule). See [here](https://statsnotes.github.io/#appendix-a-mathematical-methods) for the mathematics required (sections A.1 - A.6).

-   1.1: Preferences, Utility Functions, and Basics of Games
-   1.2: Dominant Strategy Equilibrium and the Prisoner's Dilemma
-   1.3: Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium
-   1.4: Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium
-   1.5: Median Voter Theory and Spatial Models
-   1.6: Further Spatial Models
-   1.7: Dynamic Games and Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
-   1.8: Repeated Games and Cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemma
-   1.9: Imperfect and Incomplete Information
-   1.10: Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium
-   1.11: Signalling Games and Applications

<br />

## Part II: Democratic Elections and Institutions

*This part takes the concepts discussed in Part I, and applies it to the study of democratic institutions, such as elections, media, and political parties.*

Pre-requisites: Part I, and some understanding of [statistics/econometrics](https://statsnotes.github.io) (particularly parts I and II).

<br />

## Part III: Autocratic Politics and Democratisation

*This part takes the concepts in Part I, and applies it to the study of non-democratic states and democratisation*.

Pre-requisites: Part I, and some understanding of [statistics/econometrics](https://statsnotes.github.io) (particularly parts I and II).

<br />

## Part IV: Behavioural Political Economy

*This part takes the concepts discussed in Part I and applies them to understanding the decisions of politicians, candidates, policy makers, and other political actors.*

Pre-requisites: Part I, and some understanding of [statistics/econometrics](https://statsnotes.github.io) (particularly parts I and II).

## About the Author

This website was created by Kevin Lingfeng Li.

-   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlingfengli/) \| [Website](https://kevinli03.github.io/)
-   My other guide on [statistics for social scientists](https://statsnotes.github.io).

I am a candidate for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), focusing on Applied Statistics/Econometrics. Prior to my Masters, I completed a BSc in Politics at Kingâ€™s College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. During my Undergraduate Degree, I also took classes in Data Science + Machine Learning and Accounting at the London School of Economics.

I created this page as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that it would be useful for me, and for my fellow students, to have a collection of Political Science resources in one place.

I do my best to update this website: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.
