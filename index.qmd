This is a collection of resources relating to Political Science and Political Economy, that I have gathered during my masters degree at LSE. Click on the blocks to open/close them.

## Political Science and Political Economy

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
# Quantitative Methods (Causal Inference) with R

Background Material: [Linear Algebra](https://politicalscience.github.io/maths/1.html), Calculus, Basic Statistics

**Foundations:**

-   [Multiple Linear Regression](https://politicalscience.github.io/regression/1.html) (not causal)
-   [Introductory Econometric Theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/0.html) (about theory of estimators)
-   [Causal Frameworks and Estimands](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/1.html) (frameworks for causality)

**Methods/Research Designs:**

-   [Randomised Experiments](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/2.html)
-   [Selection on Observables](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/3.html)
-   Instrumental Variables
-   Regression Discontinuity
-   Differences-in-Differences
-   Synthetic Controls
-   Causal Trees

If you want to see more different statistical models (not causal, but very useful for measurement/prediction), scroll down to the **statistical models** section.

## Statistical Models

Note! Statistical models do not show causality! You need a causal identification strategy to identify causal effects (see the above section on causal inference).

**Regression and Extensions:**

-   [Linear Regression Model](https://politicalscience.github.io/regression/1.html)
-   Logistic Regression Model
-   Regression for Counts
-   [Random Forest and Bagging](https://politicalscience.github.io/regression/4.html)

**Multivariate Statistical Models**

-   [Principle Components Analysis](https://politicalscience.github.io/multivariate/1.html)
-   [Factor Analysis Models](https://politicalscience.github.io/multivariate/2.html)
-   Latent Trait Models
-   Latent Class Models
-   Cluster Analysis
-   Structural Equation Models

## Essential Mathematics

Some useful references for mathematics. This is not for teaching mathematics - see [David Siegel's](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveASiegel/playlists) youtube channel for good materials.

-   [Linear Algebra](https://politicalscience.github.io/maths/1.html)
-   Single and Multivariable Calculus
