This site contains a collection of notes and courses/guides on quantitative methods for political science (and social sciences in general). I learned these methods throughout my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in Political Science. There are three main categories of methods included: econometric methods, game theory, and quantitative methods.

Note: this is a work in progress, not everything is complete.

| #### [Very Applied Econometrics for Social Scientists](https://politicalscience.github.io/applied)                                                                                                                                      |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| This course contains the "essential" topics needed for statistical and causal analysis in the social sciences. Little to no mathematics is used. Examples of implementation in R are provided. Great way to intuitively learn concepts. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| #### [Econometric Methods for Social Scientists](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics)                                                                                                                                            |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| This course is a more complete and larger course on econometrics, which involves more mathematics. I highly recommend anyone without statistical/econometric experience do the previous course before approaching this one.             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| #### [Game Theory and Political Economics](https://politicalscience.github.io/gametheory)                                                                                                                                               |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| This course introduces mathematical modelling of political situations with Game Theory. Topics include basic microeconomic principles, game theory and formal models, and applications to political phenomena.                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| #### [Quantitative Methods (for Social Scientists)](https://politicalscience.github.io/maths)                                                                                                                                           |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| This course introduces key mathematical techniques, probability theory, and statistical theory that are necessary for the study of political science. This is meant to be a "companion" to the other courses.                           |

# About the Author {#creator}

This website was created by Kevin L. Li

I am a candidate for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economy at the London School of Economics (LSE), focusing on Applied Statistics/Econometrics. Prior to my Masters, I completed a BSc in Politics at King's College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. During my Undergraduate Degree, I also took classes in Data Science + Machine Learning and Accounting at the London School of Economics.

I created this page as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that it would be useful for me, and for my fellow students, to have a collection of Political Science resources in one place.

I do my best to update this website: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.

# Resources for Learning Statistics and R-Programming {#resources}

-   For those who need an introduction to statistics, I recommend the **Khan Academy** course on AP Stats for a mathematical introduction: <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics>

-   There is also a terrific free textbook on **Statistical learning with applications to R**: <https://www.statlearning.com>

-   **BurkeyAcademy** provides free online econometrics courses and implementations in R: <https://www.burkeyacademy.com/statistics-econometrics>

-   For more advanced individuals who want to learn more in-depth about statistics, see this excellent **MIT lecture series**: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61ATaGTFcSp7bhogloD2wHP>

-   A free resource to learn R with is **CodeAcademy**: <https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-r>

-   For those who have spare cash to spend, there is an excellent R programming course **(Data Analysis with R) offered by IBM on Coursera**, which teaches R and statistics: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-r>

-   I also highly recommend those who can afford it, to attend the **London School of Economic (LSE) Summer School**, which has an excellent course - **ME314 Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning**. Many of these methods are covered in depth in this course, and the course is run by one of the developers of Quanteda, the main textual-analysis R package.
