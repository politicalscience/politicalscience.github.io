Here is a collection of materials on **key topics** and **methodology** in political science that I have obtained through my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees!

## Quantitative Methods in Political Science

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Regression Models

Note! Regression does not show causality! You need a causal identification strategy to identify causal effects (see the next section on causal inference).

**The Generalised Linear Model:**

1.  [Linear Regression Model](https://politicalscience.github.io/regression/1.html)
2.  Logistic Regression Model
3.  Regression for Counts
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Methods for Causal Inference

This section is about measuring the size of causal effects.

1.  [Ordinary Least Squares Theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/1.html)
2.  [Causal Frameworks and Estimands](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/2.html)
3.  [Randomised Experiments](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/3.html)
4.  Selection on Observables
5.  Instrumental Variables
6.  Regression Discontinuity
7.  Differences-in-Differences

**Additional Topics:**

8.  Causal Inference with Spatial Data
9.  Synthetic Controls
10. Causal Trees and Machine Learning
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Methods for Measurement

This section is about models that can help us measure latent (unobservable or unmeasurable) variables, and textual data.

**Multivariate Measurement:**

1.  [Principle Components Analysis](https://politicalscience.github.io/multivariate/1.html)
2.  Exploratory Factor Analysis
3.  Confirmatory Factor Analysis
4.  Latent Trait Models
5.  Latent Class Models
6.  Cluster Analysis
7.  Structural Equation Models

**Measurement of Textual Data:**

1.  Dictionary Methods
2.  Classification of Texts
3.  Latent Trait Scales for Text
4.  Text Similarity and Clustering
5.  Structural Topic Models

## Topics in Political Science

A [quick guide to game theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/guides/games.html) to help with this section.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Electoral Politics

This section introduces some of the major models on how political parties and voters behave in elections, and the consequences of these behaviours.

1.  Median Voter Theory: Parties Converge at the Centre?
2.  Valence Politics - Elections are not just about Policy
3.  [Information and Elections: How does Fake News Affect Outcomes?](https://politicalscience.github.io/elections/3.html)
4.  Elections and the Incentive of Politicians to put in Effort
5.  Elections as a Tool of Selection
6.  Rise of Populist Parties.

## Political Institutions

This section discusses how the design of political institutions affects the outcomes of political processes.

1.  The Prisoner's Dilemma and Potential for Cooperation
2.  Legislative Bargaining Models
3.  Divide the Budget Models
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Autocracies and Democracies

1.  Democratic Backsliding
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Politics of Conflict

1.  War and Peace
2.  Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Discrimination

## About the Author

This handbook was created by Kevin Li.

I am a postgraduate student at the London School of Economics. My primary interests is the use of econometrics and quantitative methods to study political phenomena. I also am a current intern at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

I created this page to consolidate everything I have learned about political science into one place. I hope this can help other people interested in learning political science.
