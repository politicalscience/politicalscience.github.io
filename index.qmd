# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a collection of resources and notes on statistics for political science that I have collected throughout my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.

The first part of this collection is regarding statistical theory of inference and estimators. We start with the some basic statistics in the form of distributions and random variables, as well as the basics of statistical inference. Then, we cover a series of estimators and the theory behind them. Finally, we discuss the basics of causality in statistics.

The second part of the collection is more applied - showing how methods can be implemented for prediction and causal inference. We introduce different types of models, and how we can implement them with R code. If you are already comfortable with statistical theory, you can probably skip ahead to these applied chapters, and refer to the statistical theory chapters as references.

For the content in this guide, I assume some experience with basic statistics, such as a basic idea of sampling and statistical inference. I will review many of these concepts in the first two chapters. I also assume strong mathematical fundamentals, including calculus, linear algebra, and basic probability. There is some supplementary material provided in the appendix.

I am continuously adding more to this collection as a learn more. Some parts may be incomplete, and you may see some changes in existing parts.

# Notation

I will use a variety of notation in this guide. I will do my best to remain consistent with the notation throughout all chapters.

For common statistical operators, I denote them as following:

-   Probability $\P(\cdot)$.
-   Expectation $\E(\cdot)$.
-   Variance $\V(\cdot)$.
-   Covariance $Cov(\cdot, \cdot)$.

Random variables will typically be denoted by an uppercase letter, for example $X$. A realisation of this variable (for example, in a sample), will be denoted with lowercase $x$.

I will use matrices and vectors frequently in this guide. Matrices are denoted with a bold capital letter $\b X$, and vectors are denoted with a bold lowercase letter $\b x$. Transposes will be denoted $\b X^\top$.

To be very clear regarding probability density functions and cumulative density functions, I will always specify the variable in question as a subscript, for example, $f_Y(y)$ and $F_Y(y)$.

For indexes related to random variables and samples, I have made a few notational choices.

-   For observation of a sample/population, I will use index $t$ to refer to a specific observation (Ex. $Y_t$), no matter if it is cross-sectional or time series data. This choice is consistent with Amemiya's notation.
-   For number of parameters in a model, I will use $p$ (ex. $X_p$), which is the standard in statistics. However, econometricians will often use $k$ to refer to the number of parameters.
