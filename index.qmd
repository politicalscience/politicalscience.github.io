Here is a collection of materials on **key topics** and **methodology** in political science that I have obtained through my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees!

## Political Science and Political Economy

A [quick guide to game theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/guides/games.html) for reference.

## Topics in Political Science and Political Economy

This section contains a variety of topics in political science that I find interesting.

**Elections and Democracies**

1.  [Elections and Policy Competition](https://politicalscience.github.io/topics/1.html)
2.  [The Uses of Elections](https://politicalscience.github.io/topics/2.html)
3.  The Rise of Populism
4.  Democratic Backsliding

**Political Institutions**

5.  The Prisoner's Dilemma and Potential for Cooperation
6.  Legislative Bargaining and Institutional Design

**Politics of Conflict**

7.  War and Peace
8.  Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism
:::

## Quantitative Methods

R-Code is provided for methods.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Regression and Extensions

Note! Regression does not show causality! You need a causal identification strategy to identify causal effects (see the next section on causal inference).

**The Generalised Linear Model:**

1.  [Linear Regression Model](https://politicalscience.github.io/regression/1.html)
2.  Logistic Regression Model
3.  Regression for Counts

**Extensions:**

4.  Random Forest and Bagging

## Causal Inference

This section is about measuring the size of causal effects.

1.  [Ordinary Least Squares Theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/1.html)
2.  [Causal Frameworks and Estimands](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/2.html)
3.  [Randomised Experiments](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/3.html)
4.  [Selection on Observables](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/4.html)
5.  Instrumental Variables
6.  Regression Discontinuity
7.  Differences-in-Differences
8.  Synthetic Controls
9.  Causal Trees and Machine Learning
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Multivariate Statistics and Measurement

This section is about models that can help us measure latent (unobservable or unmeasurable) variables with multiple observable indicators.

1.  [Principle Components Analysis](https://politicalscience.github.io/multivariate/1.html)
2.  [Factor Analysis Models](https://politicalscience.github.io/multivariate/2.html)
3.  Latent Trait Models
4.  Latent Class Models
5.  Cluster Analysis
6.  Structural Equation Models
