This is a collection of resources on **key topics** and **methodology** relating to Political Science and Political Economy, that I have gathered through my undergraduate and postgraduate education.

## Key Topics in PSPE

A [quick guide to game theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/guides/games.html) for reference.

## Key Topics in PSPE

This section contains a variety of topics in political science that I find interesting.

**Elections and Democracies**

1.  [Elections and Policy Competition](https://politicalscience.github.io/topics/1.html)

3.  The Rise of Populism
4.  Democratic Backsliding

**Political Institutions**

5.  The Prisoner's Dilemma and Potential for Cooperation
6.  Legislative Bargaining and Institutional Design

**Politics of Conflict**

7.  War and Peace
8.  Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism

## Quantitative Methods for PSPE

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Regression and Extensions

Note! Regression does not show causality! You need a causal identification strategy to identify causal effects (see the next section on causal inference).

**The Generalised Linear Model:**

1.  [Linear Regression Model](https://politicalscience.github.io/regression/1.html)
2.  Logistic Regression Model
3.  Regression for Counts

**Extensions:**

4.  Spatial Regression Models
5.  Time Series Models
6.  [Random Forest and Bagging](https://politicalscience.github.io/regression/6.html)

<br />

*Content in this section is taken from MY452 Applied Regression Analysis, EC2C1 Econometrics II, EC2C4 Econometrics II, GV481 Quantitative Analysis, and ME314 Data Science and Machine Learning.*

## Causal Inference

This section is about finding ways to identify and measure the size of causal effects in both experimental and observational settings.

1.  [Ordinary Least Squares Theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/1.html)
2.  [Causal Frameworks and Estimands](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/2.html)
3.  [Randomised Experiments](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/3.html)
4.  [Selection on Observables](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/4.html)
5.  Instrumental Variables
6.  Regression Discontinuity
7.  Differences-in-Differences
8.  Synthetic Controls
9.  Causal Trees

## Notes on Notation

I try to keep the notation I use relatively consistent, but sometimes it does differ depending on the "field" or topic.

Here are some of the notation I am using for reference:

-   $\in$ means "in". I use this to denote that an element $a$ is in some set: $a \in A$ or $a \in \{a_1, a_2, \dots \}$.
-   $\forall$ means "for all". I typically use this to indicate that a condition must be true for all elements $x$ in some set: $\forall \ x \in \mathcal X$.
-   $\because$ means "because". I typically use this in annotations to explain how I got from one step to another.
-   $\wedge$ indicates an "and" condition, and $\vee$ indicates an "or" condition. Similarly, $A \cap B$ is a intersection (and), and $A \cup B$ is a union (or).
-   For estimators, I will use a hat: $\hat a$. For estimands, I omit the hat.
-   For probabilities, I notate them as $Pr(a)$. Sometimes, I will use $\pi$ (especially in statistical sections).
-   For expectations, I notate them as $E(a)$.
-   For probabilities and expectations, $Pr(A|B)$ and $E(A|B)$ indicate conditional on $B$.
-   I notate vectors as bolded lowercase letters $\mathbf a$, and matrices as bolded uppercase letters $\mathbf A$. Dimensions may be included such as $\mathbf a_2$ or $\mathbf A_{2 \times 2}$. Elements within a matrix will be notated with unbolded $a_{ij}$, where $i$ is the row and $j$ is the column of the element.
-   Matrix inverses are notated $\mathbf A^{-1}$, and matrix transposes are notated $\mathbf A^T$.
-   Random variables are one thing that is not consistent in the notation. For the *regression* section, I typically notate random variables with a lowercase letter, such as $x_i$. This is in line with the econometrics literature. For the *causal inference* section, I typically notate random variables with uppercase letters, such as $X_i$, which is more common in the causal inference/statistics literature.
-   I specify distributions of random variables with a $\sim$. For example, a random variable $X$ with normal distribution would be denoted $X \sim \mathcal N(0, 1)$, and a random variable $X$ with uniform distribution would be denoted $X \sim \mathcal U[a, b]$.
-   I typically notate the error term in a regression with $u$, as seen in the econometrics literature, rather than $\epsilon$.
-   A sample mean is usually denoted with a bar: $\bar Y$.
-   I define functions in the form $f: x \rightarrow y$ - which indicates function $f$ is a mapping of $x$ onto $y$.
-   I define utility functions in the form of $u_i(a)$, where $i$ is the individual/unit who the utility belongs to, and $a$ is something that affects that utility.
-   Derivatives are notated in multiple ways, including $f'(x)$, $\frac{d}{dx}$. Partial derivatives are notated as $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$.
-   I utilise $\succsim$ to indicate a weak preference relation, $\succ$ to indicate a strict preference relation, and $\sim$ to indicate indifference.
