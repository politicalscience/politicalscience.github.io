# Overview

This is a collection of materials and information on political science quantitative methods (statistics, data science, game theory) that I have compiled over my years of studying political science.

-   I am posting these notes on this page as a helpful resource for myself, classmates, and others. I try to make my notes clear so they are understandable.

<!-- -->

-   This page includes 4 different courses, each with a set of modules that contain related topics. The 4 courses are:

    -   [Statistics/Econometrics for Political Science](https://politicalscience.github.io/#statisticseconometrics-for-political-science)

    -   [Applied Machine Learning](https://politicalscience.github.io/#applied-machine-learning)

    -   [Game Theory for Political Science](https://politicalscience.github.io/#game-theory-for-political-science)

    -   [Mathematics for Political Science](https://politicalscience.github.io/#mathematics-for-political-science)

# Statistics/Econometrics for Political Science

This is a full course in statistics/econometrics, experimental design, and causal inference for Political Science.

-   The modules are meant to be learned in order, so later modules assume knowledge on earlier modules.

-   Other prerequisites and requirements are laid out in the respective modules.

-   The course primarily uses the R-programming language

-   Some math background from [Mathematics for Political Science](https://politicalscience.github.io/#mathematics-for-political-science) would be very useful

| Module | Lesson Topics |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1 Introductory Statistical Theory | Basics of Probability, Random Variables, Statistical Inference, Difference in Means, Correlation |
| 2 Linear Regression Analysis | Simple Linear Regression, Different Types of Explanatory Variables, Assumptions and Model Selection, Panel and Clustered Data |
| 3 Logistic Regression Analysis | Definition and Interpretation, Estimation and Inference, Ordinal and Multinomial Logistic Regression |
| 4 Causal Inference and Random Experiments | Causal Frameworks, Randomisation and Experiments |
| 5 Causal Inference for Observational Studies | Instrumental Variables, Selection on Observables, Differences-in-Differences, Regression Discontinuity |
| 6 Multivariate Dimensional Reduction | Principle Components Analysis, Factor Analysis, Cluster Analysis |
| 7 Multivariate Latent Variable Analysis | Latent Trait Models, Latent Class Models, Structural Equation Modelling |

<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Applied Machine Learning

This course is about machine learning techniques employed in the social sciences.

-   The modules are meant to be learned in order, so later modules assume knowledge on earlier modules.

-   This course assumes knowledge up to the end of module 3 of [Statistics/Econometrics for Political Science](https://politicalscience.github.io/#statisticseconometrics-for-political-science)

-   Other prerequisites and requirements are laid out in the respective modules.

-   The course primarily uses the R-programming language

-   Some math background from [Mathematics for Political Science](https://politicalscience.github.io/#mathematics-for-political-science) would be very useful

| Module | Lesson Topics |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1 Non-Linear Prediction Models | Polynomial Models, Step Functions and Splines, Local Linear Regression, Generalised Additive Models, Bagging and Random Forest |
| 2 Classification Methods | Naive Bayes Classifier, Tree-Based Classifier, Evaluation of Classification Models |
| 3 Model Selection and Validation | Training and Testing Sets, K-Fold Cross Validation, Bootstrap Sampling, Regularisation |
| 4 Multivariate Dimensional Reduction | Principle Components Analysis, Factor Analysis, Cluster Analysis |
| 5 Text Mining | Text Analysis Basics, Sentiment Analysis, Similarity Metrics, Text-Based Classification, Topic Models |

<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Mathematics for Political Science

This is an important module that establishes the foundations in which other methods build on

-   This course assumes some familiarity with high school level mathematics

-   This course is often very useful, if not essential, to understanding the quantitative methods used in Political Science

| Module | Lesson Topics |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| [1 Topics in Algebra](https://politicalscience.github.io/mathematics/1.html) | Set Theory, Algebra Fundamentals, Exponents & Logarithms, Sum & Product Notation, Functions, Limits & Continuity |
| 2 Single Variable Calculus | Derivatives, Partial Derivatives, Optimisation, Integrals |
| 3 Vectors and Matrices | Vector Algebra, Matrix Algebra, Matrix Determinant, Matrices and OLS |
| 4 Vector Spaces and Systems of Equations |  |
| 5 Eigenvalues and Markov Chains |  |
| 6 Multivariate Calculus |  |
| 7 Multivariate Optimisation |  |

<br />

# Game Theory for Political Science

Game Theory is the mathematical modelling of decision making, and is key to political science and other social sciences. This is a course for Game Theory and its uses in Political Science

-   The modules are meant to be learned in order, so later modules assume knowledge on earlier modules.

-   Other prerequisites and requirements are laid out in the respective modules.

-   Some math background from [Mathematics for Political Science](https://politicalscience.github.io/#mathematics-for-political-science) would be very useful

| Module | Lesson Topics |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1 Static Games | Introduction to Game Theory, Nash Equilibrium and Static Games, Spatial Models, Mixed Strategies |
| 2 Dynamic Games | Dynamic Games of Complete Information, Imperfect and Incomplete Information, Bayesian Games |
| 3 Advanced Games | Nim and Combinatorial Games, Bimatrix Games |

# About the Creator {#creator}

This handbook was created by Kevin Lingfeng Li, in R-Markdown!

-   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlingfengli/)

I am a candidate for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economy at the London School of Economics (LSE), focusing on Applied Statistical Methodology. Prior to my Masters, I completed a BSc in Politics at King's College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. During my Undergraduate Degree, I also took classes in Data Science + Machine Learning and Accounting at the London School of Economics.

I created this page as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that it would be useful for me, and for my fellow students, to have a collection of Political Science resources in one place.

I do my best to update this handbook: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.

# Resources for Learning Statistics and R-Programming {#resources}

-   For those who need an introduction to statistics, I recommend the **Khan Academy** course on AP Stats for a mathematical introduction: <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics>

-   There is also a terrific free textbook on **Statistical learning with applications to R**: <https://www.statlearning.com>

-   **BurkeyAcademy** provides free online econometrics courses and implementations in R: <https://www.burkeyacademy.com/statistics-econometrics>

-   For more advanced individuals who want to learn more in-depth about statistics, see this excellent **MIT lecture series**: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61ATaGTFcSp7bhogloD2wHP>

-   A free resource to learn R with is **CodeAcademy**: <https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-r>

-   For those who have spare cash to spend, there is an excellent R programming course **(Data Analysis with R) offered by IBM on Coursera**, which teaches R and statistics: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-r>

-   I also highly recommend those who can afford it, to attend the **London School of Economic (LSE) Summer School**, which has an excellent course - **ME314 Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning**. Many of these methods are covered in depth in this course, and the course is run by one of the developers of Quanteda, the main textual-analysis R package.
