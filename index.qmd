This is a collection of resources relating to Political Science and Political Economy, that I have gathered during my masters degree at LSE. I hope this collection can be of use to me and other students.

<br />

## Navigating the Collection

Use the **left sidebar** for navigation between topics. The topics in this collection include:

1.  **Game Theory** (formal mathematical modelling of politics)
2.  **Quantitative Methods for Causal Inference**. R-code is provided for implementation.
3.  **Further Statistical Models** (other regressions, multivariate latent models, etc.). R-code is provided for implementation purposes.
4.  Some quick refresher resources on **Mathematics**, specifically linear algebra and calculus.
