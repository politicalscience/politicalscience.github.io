# Appendix: Topics in Mathematics

This is a supplemental section to the other modules. This section contains most of the mathematics that are needed for the methods utilised in this handbook. If you need a refresher on any of the mathematics involved, this is the place to reference.

While it may be possible to learn mathematics from this section, this isn't the goal of this section. There is no practice problems, and practice is essential for learning maths. This section mainly is a refresher for concepts relevant to Political Science.

| Module | Chapters |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1 Additional Topics in Calculus and Linear Algebra | Fills in some of the gaps from Module 1, including integration by parts and substitution, as well as matrix transposition, Kronecker product, and matrix determinants |
| 3 Vector Spaces and Systems of Equations |  |
| 4 Eigenvalues and Markov Chains |  |
| 5 Multivariate Calculus |  |
| 6 Multivariate Optimisation |  |

# About the Author {#creator}

This handbook was created by Kevin L. Li

I am a candidate for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economy at the London School of Economics (LSE), focusing on Applied Statistics/Econometrics. Prior to my Masters, I completed a BSc in Politics at King's College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. During my Undergraduate Degree, I also took classes in Data Science + Machine Learning and Accounting at the London School of Economics.

I created this page as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that it would be useful for me, and for my fellow students, to have a collection of Political Science resources in one place.

I do my best to update this handbook: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.

# Resources for Learning Statistics and R-Programming {#resources}

-   For those who need an introduction to statistics, I recommend the **Khan Academy** course on AP Stats for a mathematical introduction: <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics>

-   There is also a terrific free textbook on **Statistical learning with applications to R**: <https://www.statlearning.com>

-   **BurkeyAcademy** provides free online econometrics courses and implementations in R: <https://www.burkeyacademy.com/statistics-econometrics>

-   For more advanced individuals who want to learn more in-depth about statistics, see this excellent **MIT lecture series**: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61ATaGTFcSp7bhogloD2wHP>

-   A free resource to learn R with is **CodeAcademy**: <https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-r>

-   For those who have spare cash to spend, there is an excellent R programming course **(Data Analysis with R) offered by IBM on Coursera**, which teaches R and statistics: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-r>

-   I also highly recommend those who can afford it, to attend the **London School of Economic (LSE) Summer School**, which has an excellent course - **ME314 Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning**. Many of these methods are covered in depth in this course, and the course is run by one of the developers of Quanteda, the main textual-analysis R package.
