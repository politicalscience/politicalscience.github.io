# Preface

This is a collection of materials and information on political science quantitative methods that I have compiled over my years of studying political science, focusing on modern quantitative methodology and its applications to Political Science Research and other Social Sciences. This handbook is divided into sections, which are further subdivided into modules, which are further subdivided into chapters. The appendix contains notes on mathematics relevant to some of the methods. The sections do not have to be done in order, although it is recommended to start with sections 0 and 1, as they form the basis of much of what comes next.

In terms of executing statistical methods, this handbook will mainly focus on the R programming language, but will also provide some information on Python and Stata.

<br />

# Section 0: Essentials

This section introduces essential concepts in Mathematics and Probability, that are needed for the rest of the modules in the course. If you have a strong basis in Maths/Probability, you may skip these modules, or quickly review them.

| Module | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| [1 Essential Algebra](https://politicalscience.github.io/section0/1.html) | Algebra topics that are essential for the rest of the course, for both methods, and the second module on calculus and linear algebra |
| [2 Essential Calculus and Linear Algebra](https://politicalscience.github.io/section0/2.html) | Selected topics in calculus and simple linear algebra that will be referenced throughout the handbook |
| [3 Essential Probability Theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/section0/3.html) | Topics in sets, probabilities, and random variables, that form the basis of statistical theory |

<br />

# Section 1: Core Statistical Methods

These modules introduce you to the core statistical/econometric methods of Political Science.

| Module | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| [4 Introductory Statistical Inference](https://politicalscience.github.io/section1/4.html) | Introduction to sampling, statistical inference, and hypothesis testing, along with a few simple statistical tests. |
| 5 Linear Regression Analysis | Analysis of the linear regression model, arguably the most important tool of political science quantitative methods. |
| 6 Other Regression Methods | Analysis of other common regression models used in the social sciences, including logistic regression and regression for counts. |
| 7 Introductory Causal Inference | Discussion of causal inference frameworks, controlled randomised experiments, and a brief introduction into causal inference for observational studies. |
| 8 Quasi-Experimental Methods | Analysis of the common causal inference techniques for social sciences, including instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and differences in differences. |

<br />

# Section 2: Formal Mathematical Models

These modules provide an introduction to Game Theory/Formal Theory and mathematical models of decision making and political situations.

| Module | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| [9 Introduction and Static Games](https://politicalscience.github.io/section2/9.html) | Introduction to the idea of game theory, key concepts of games, equilibrium concepts, and static games. |
| 10 Dynamic Games of Complete Information | Discussion of non-simultaneous games and repeated games, with relevant political examples. |
| 11 Bayesian Games | Discussion of dynamic games of incomplete information and perfect bayesian equilibrium. |
| 12 Modelling and Political Economy | Application of formal mathematical models to common situations in Political Science and Political Economy |

<br />

# Section 3: Modern Data Science Methods

Introduction to the advanced prediction methods of machine learning, as well as methods to analyse textual data

| Module | Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 13 Prediction Methods | Discussion of non-linear and tree-based prediction methods |
| 14 Classification Methods | Discussion of Naive Bayes and tree-based classifiers |
| 15 Model Selection and Regularisation | Discussion of model selection, and regularisation techniques such as Lasso and Ridge |
| 16 Text Mining | Introduction to the use of machine learning techniques to analyse textual data |

: <br />

# Section 4: Advanced Statistical Methods

Introduction to advanced methods regarding multivariate measurement and methods, as well as time series

| Module | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 17 Multivariate Measurement | Discussion of non-model measurement methods such as Principle Components Analysis and Cluster Analysis |
| 18 Latent Variable Modelling | Modelling of latent variables, such as factor analysis, latent trait and class models |
| 19 Structural Equation Models |  |

<br />

# Appendix: Topics in Mathematics

This is a supplemental section to the other modules. This section contains most of the mathematics that are needed for the methods utilised in this handbook. If you need a refresher on any of the mathematics involved, this is the place to reference.

While it may be possible to learn mathematics from this section, this isn't the goal of this section. There is no practice problems, and practice is essential for learning maths. This section mainly is a refresher for concepts relevant to Political Science.

| Module | Chapters |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1 Additional Topics in Calculus and Linear Algebra | Fills in some of the gaps from Module 1, including integration by parts and substitution, as well as matrix transposition, Kronecker product, and matrix determinants |
| 3 Vector Spaces and Systems of Equations |  |
| 4 Eigenvalues and Markov Chains |  |
| 5 Multivariate Calculus |  |
| 6 Multivariate Optimisation |  |

# About the Author {#creator}

This handbook was created by Kevin L. Li

-   [Website](https://kevinli03.github.io)

I am a candidate for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economy at the London School of Economics (LSE), focusing on Applied Statistics/Econometrics. Prior to my Masters, I completed a BSc in Politics at King's College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. During my Undergraduate Degree, I also took classes in Data Science + Machine Learning and Accounting at the London School of Economics.

I created this page as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that it would be useful for me, and for my fellow students, to have a collection of Political Science resources in one place.

I do my best to update this handbook: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.

# Resources for Learning Statistics and R-Programming {#resources}

-   For those who need an introduction to statistics, I recommend the **Khan Academy** course on AP Stats for a mathematical introduction: <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics>

-   There is also a terrific free textbook on **Statistical learning with applications to R**: <https://www.statlearning.com>

-   **BurkeyAcademy** provides free online econometrics courses and implementations in R: <https://www.burkeyacademy.com/statistics-econometrics>

-   For more advanced individuals who want to learn more in-depth about statistics, see this excellent **MIT lecture series**: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61ATaGTFcSp7bhogloD2wHP>

-   A free resource to learn R with is **CodeAcademy**: <https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-r>

-   For those who have spare cash to spend, there is an excellent R programming course **(Data Analysis with R) offered by IBM on Coursera**, which teaches R and statistics: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-r>

-   I also highly recommend those who can afford it, to attend the **London School of Economic (LSE) Summer School**, which has an excellent course - **ME314 Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning**. Many of these methods are covered in depth in this course, and the course is run by one of the developers of Quanteda, the main textual-analysis R package.
