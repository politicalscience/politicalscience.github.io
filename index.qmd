This is a collection of resources on **key topics** and **methodology** relating to Political Science and Political Economy, that I have gathered through my undergraduate and postgraduate education.

## Key Topics in PSPE

A [quick guide to game theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/guides/games.html) for reference.

## Key Topics in PSPE

This section contains a variety of topics in political science that I find interesting.

**Elections and Democracies**

1.  [Elections and Policy Competition](https://politicalscience.github.io/topics/1.html)
2.  [The Uses of Elections](https://politicalscience.github.io/topics/2.html)
3.  The Rise of Populism
4.  Democratic Backsliding

**Political Institutions**

5.  The Prisoner's Dilemma and Potential for Cooperation
6.  Legislative Bargaining and Institutional Design

**Politics of Conflict**

7.  War and Peace
8.  Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism

<br />

*Content in this section is taken from GV482 Current Issues, GV325 Topics in Political Economy, and GV4C8 Game Theory.*

## Quantitative Methods for PSPE

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Regression and Extensions

Note! Regression does not show causality! You need a causal identification strategy to identify causal effects (see the next section on causal inference).

**The Generalised Linear Model:**

1.  [Linear Regression Model](https://politicalscience.github.io/regression/1.html)
2.  Logistic Regression Model
3.  Regression for Counts

**Extensions:**

4.  Spatial Regression Models
5.  Time Series Models
6.  [Random Forest and Bagging](https://politicalscience.github.io/regression/6.html)

<br />

*Content in this section is taken from MY452 Applied Regression Analysis, EC2C1 Econometrics II, EC2C4 Econometrics II, GV481 Quantitative Analysis, and ME314 Data Science and Machine Learning.*

## Causal Inference

This section is about finding ways to identify and measure the size of causal effects in both experimental and observational settings.

1.  [Ordinary Least Squares Theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/1.html)
2.  [Causal Frameworks and Estimands](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/2.html)
3.  [Randomised Experiments](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/3.html)
4.  [Selection on Observables](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/4.html)
5.  Instrumental Variables
6.  Regression Discontinuity
7.  Differences-in-Differences
8.  Synthetic Controls
9.  Causal Trees

<br />

*Content in this section is taken from MY457 Causal Inference, GV481 Quantitative Analysis, EC2C1 Econometrics II, and DV496 Applied Econometrics. Further content from Angrist & Pischke (2009), Imbens & Rubin (2015), Huntington-Klien (2022), Pearl (2009), and Pearl (2016).*

## Multivariate Measurement

This section is about models that can help us measure latent (unobservable or unmeasurable) variables with multiple observable indicators.

1.  [Principle Components Analysis](https://politicalscience.github.io/multivariate/1.html)
2.  [Factor Analysis Models](https://politicalscience.github.io/multivariate/2.html)
3.  Latent Trait Models
4.  Latent Class Models
5.  Cluster Analysis
6.  Structural Equation Models

<br />

*Content in this section is taken from MY455 Multivariate Measurement and Analysis and ST405 Multivariate Methods.*

## Essential Mathematics

Some useful references for mathematics. This is not for teaching mathematics - see [David Siegel's](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveASiegel/playlists) youtube channel for good materials.

1.  [Matrices and Vectors](https://politicalscience.github.io/maths/1.html)
2.  [Linear Algebra](https://politicalscience.github.io/maths/2.html)
3.  Single and Multivariable Calculus
4.  Probability and Statistical Theory
