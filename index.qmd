Here you can learn more about **key topics** and **methodology** in political science!

## Quantitative Methods in Political Science

I assume an understanding of linear regression. [Quick guide to linear regression](https://politicalscience.github.io/guides/linear.html).

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Applied Econometrics/Causal Inference

This section is about establishing the size of causal effects through statistics. I assume an understanding of linear regression and linear algebra.

1.  Ordinary Least Squares Theory
2.  Causal Frameworks and Estimands
3.  Randomised Controlled Trials
4.  Instrumental Variables
5.  Shift-Share and Bartik Instruments
6.  Regression Discontinuity
7.  Differences-in-Differences
8.  Advancements in Differences-in-Differences

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Multivariate Statistics and Measurement

This section is about models that can help us measure latent (unobservable or unmeasurable) variables, and conduct dimensional reduction. I assume an understanding of linear regression and linear algebra.

1.  Principle Components Analysis
2.  Exploratory Factor Analysis
3.  Confirmatory Factor Analysis
4.  Latent Trait Models
5.  Latent Class Models
6.  Structural Equation Models

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Simple Machine Learning

This section introduces simple machine learning models that are increasingly being adopted in Political Science for predictive purposes.

1.  Generalised Additive Models
2.  Random Forest and Bagging
3.  Classification with Naive Bayes and Random Forest
4.  Dictionary Methods for Text
5.  Classification for Textual Methods
6.  Structural Topic Models
:::

## Topics in Political Science

A [quick guide to game theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/guides/games.html) to help with this section.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Electoral Politics

This section introduces some of the major models on how political parties and voters behave in elections, and the consequences of these behaviours.

1.  Median Voter Theory: Parties Converge at the Centre?
2.  Valence Politics - Elections are not just about Policy
3.  [Information and Elections: How does Fake News Affect Outcomes?](https://politicalscience.github.io/elections/3.html)
4.  Elections and the Incentive of Politicians to put in Effort
5.  Elections as a Tool of Selection
6.  Rise of Populist Parties.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Political Institutions

This section discusses how the design of political institutions affects the outcomes of political processes.

1.  The Prisoner's Dilemma and Potential for Cooperation
2.  Legislative Bargaining Models
3.  Divide the Budget Models

:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Politics of Conflict

1.  War and Peace
2.  Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism

## About the Author

This handbook was created by Kevin Li.

I am a postgraduate student at the London School of Economics. My primary interests is the use of econometrics and quantitative methods to study political phenomena. I also am a current intern at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

I created this page to consolidate everything I have learned about political science into one place. I hope this can help other people interested in learning political science.
