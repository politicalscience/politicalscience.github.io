Here is a collection of materials on **key topics** and **methodology** in political science that I have obtained through my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees!

## Topics in Political Science

A [quick guide to game theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/guides/games.html) to help with this section.

## Topics in Political Science

This section contains a variety of topics in political science that I find interesting.

**Electoral Politics**

1.  [Do Parties Converge on Policy for Elections?](https://politicalscience.github.io/elections/1.html)
2.  Elections as Incentive and Selection Devices
3.  [Information and Elections: How does Fake News Affect Outcomes?](https://politicalscience.github.io/elections/3.html)
4.  Rise of Populist Parties.

**Political Institutions**

5.  The Prisoner's Dilemma and Potential for Cooperation
6.  Legislative Bargaining and Institutional Design

**Democracy and Authoritarianism**

7.  Critiques of Democracy
8.  Democratic Backsliding

**Politics of Conflict**

9.  War and Peace
10. Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism

**Discrimination**

## Quantitative Methods in Political Science

R-Code is provided for methods.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Regression

Note! Regression does not show causality! You need a causal identification strategy to identify causal effects (see the next section on causal inference).

**The Generalised Linear Model:**

1.  [Linear Regression Model](https://politicalscience.github.io/regression/1.html)
2.  Logistic Regression Model
3.  Regression for Counts

**Extra Content:**

4.  Random Forest and Bagging

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Causal Inference

This section is about measuring the size of causal effects.

1.  [Ordinary Least Squares Theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/1.html)
2.  [Causal Frameworks and Estimands](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/2.html)
3.  [Randomised Experiments](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/3.html)
4.  Selection on Observables
5.  Instrumental Variables
6.  Regression Discontinuity
7.  Differences-in-Differences

**Additional Topics:**

8.  Synthetic Controls
9.  Causal Trees and Machine Learning
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Multivariate Measurement

This section is about models that can help us measure latent (unobservable or unmeasurable) variables with multiple observable indicators.

1.  [Principle Components Analysis](https://politicalscience.github.io/multivariate/1.html)
2.  Exploratory Factor Analysis
3.  Confirmatory Factor Analysis
4.  Latent Trait Models
5.  Latent Class Models
6.  Cluster Analysis
7.  Structural Equation Models
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## Text Analysis and Measurement

This section is about methods that can help us quantify textual data and analyse textual data.

1.  Dictionary Methods
2.  Classification of Texts
3.  Latent Trait Scales for Text
4.  Text Similarity and Clustering
5.  Structural Topic Models
