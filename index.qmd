This is a collection of materials and information on political science quantitative methods that I have compiled over my years of studying political science.

This handbook is best used on a laptop. Navigate to the different sections using the navigation bar on the left.

# Preface

Political Science today is a very quantitative and mathematical discipline: open any Political Science Academic Journal, and you could mistake it for an applied statistics or applied mathematics journal. Political scientists today frequently use mathematical models to create causal hypotheses, and advanced statistical/econometric techniques to prove our causal hypotheses.

This handbook is a guide to Political Science, focusing on modern quantitative methodology and its applications to Political Science Research. I take a very "political-economy" based approach - using more quantitative tools from the discipline of economics, to study political phenomena.

This handbook is divided into sections, which are further subdivided into modules, which are further subdivided into chapters. The appendix contains notes on mathematics relevant to some of the methods. The sections do not have to be done in order, although it is recommended to start with sections 0 and 1, as they form the basis of much of what comes next.

<br />

# Section 0: Essentials

This section introduces essential concepts in Mathematics and Probability, that are needed for the rest of the modules in the course. If you have a strong basis in Maths/Probability, you may skip these modules, or quickly review them.

| Module | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| [1 Essential Algebra](https://politicalscience.github.io/section0/1.html) | Algebra topics that are essential for the rest of the course, for both methods, and the second module on calculus and linear algebra |
| [2 Essential Calculus and Linear Algebra](https://politicalscience.github.io/section0/2.html) | Selected topics in calculus and simple linear algebra that will be referenced throughout the handbook |
| [3 Essential Probability Theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/section0/3.html) | Topics in sets, probabilities, and random variables, that form the basis of statistical theory |

<br />

# Section 1: Quantitative Methods

These modules introduce you to the basics of statistical inference, and the important tool of regression analysis.

| Module | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| [4 Introductory Statistical Inference](https://politicalscience.github.io/section1/1.html) | Statistical inference from sampling and hypothesis testing |
| 5 Linear Regression Analysis | Detailed analysis of the linear regression model |
| 6 Other Regression Methods | Analysis of logistic regression and regression for counts |

<br />

# Section 2: Causal Inference

These modules introduce you to the basics of statistical inference, and the important tool of regression analysis.

| Module | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 7 Causal Frameworks and Randomisation | Disucssion of causal inference and controlled randomised experiments |
| 8 Selection on Observables |  |
| 9 Instrumental Variables |  |
| 10 Quasi-Experimental Designs | Discussion of regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences designs |

<br />

# Section 3: Formal Mathematical Models

Introduction to Game Theory/Formal Theory and mathematical models of decision making and political situations.

| Module | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 11 Static Games | Introduction to game theory, equilibrium concepts, and static games |
| 12 Dynamic Games of Complete Information | Discussion of non-simultaneous games and repeated games |
| 13 Bayesian Games | Discussion of dynamic games of incomplete information and perfect bayesian equilibria |

<br />

# Section 4: Multivariate Analysis

Introduction to advanced methods regarding multivariate measurement and methods, as well as latent variables.

| Module | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 14 Multivariate Measurement | Discussion of non-model measurement methods such as Principle Components Analysis and Cluster Analysis |
| 15 Latent Variable Modelling | Modelling of latent variables, such as factor analysis, latent trait and class models |
| 16 Structural Equation Models |  |

<br />

# Section 5: Machine Learning

Introduction to the advanced prediction methods of machine learning, as well as methods to analyse textual data

| Module | Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 17 Prediction Methods | Discussion of non-linear and tree-based prediction methods |
| 18 Classification Methods | Discussion of Naive Bayes and tree-based classifiers |
| 19 Model Selection and Regularisation | Discussion of model selection, and regularisation techniques such as Lasso and Ridge |
| 20 Text Mining | Introduction to the use of machine learning techniques to analyse textual data |

<br />

# Appendix: Topics Mathematics

This is a supplemental section to the other modules. This section contains most of the mathematics that are needed for the methods utilised in this handbook. If you need a refresher on any of the mathematics involved, this is the place to reference.

While it may be possible to learn mathematics from this section, this isn't the goal of this section. There is no practice problems, and practice is essential for learning maths. This section mainly is a refresher for concepts relevant to Political Science.

| Module | Chapters |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1 Additional Topics in Calculus and Linear Algebra | Fills in some of the gaps from Module 1, including integration by parts and substitution, as well as matrix transposition, Kronecker product, and matrix determinants |
| 3 Vector Spaces and Systems of Equations |  |
| 4 Eigenvalues and Markov Chains |  |
| 5 Multivariate Calculus |  |
| 6 Multivariate Optimisation |  |

# About the Author {#creator}

This handbook was created by Kevin L. Li

-   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlingfengli/)

I am a candidate for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economy at the London School of Economics (LSE), focusing on Applied Statistics/Econometrics. Prior to my Masters, I completed a BSc in Politics at King's College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. During my Undergraduate Degree, I also took classes in Data Science + Machine Learning and Accounting at the London School of Economics.

I created this page as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that it would be useful for me, and for my fellow students, to have a collection of Political Science resources in one place.

I do my best to update this handbook: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.

# Resources for Learning Statistics and R-Programming {#resources}

-   For those who need an introduction to statistics, I recommend the **Khan Academy** course on AP Stats for a mathematical introduction: <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics>

-   There is also a terrific free textbook on **Statistical learning with applications to R**: <https://www.statlearning.com>

-   **BurkeyAcademy** provides free online econometrics courses and implementations in R: <https://www.burkeyacademy.com/statistics-econometrics>

-   For more advanced individuals who want to learn more in-depth about statistics, see this excellent **MIT lecture series**: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61ATaGTFcSp7bhogloD2wHP>

-   A free resource to learn R with is **CodeAcademy**: <https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-r>

-   For those who have spare cash to spend, there is an excellent R programming course **(Data Analysis with R) offered by IBM on Coursera**, which teaches R and statistics: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-r>

-   I also highly recommend those who can afford it, to attend the **London School of Economic (LSE) Summer School**, which has an excellent course - **ME314 Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning**. Many of these methods are covered in depth in this course, and the course is run by one of the developers of Quanteda, the main textual-analysis R package.
