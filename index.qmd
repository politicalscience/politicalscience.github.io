## About the Author

This handbook was created by Kevin Li.

I am a postgraduate student at the London School of Economics. My primary interests is the use of econometrics and quantitative methods to study political phenomena. I also am a current intern at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

I created this page to consolidate everything I have learned about political science into one place. I hope this can help other people interested in learning political science.
