This is a collection of materials and information on political science quantitative methods that I have compiled over my years of studying political science.

-   The handbook is divided into sections, each providing detailed information on topics relevant to Political Science

This handbook is best used on a laptop. Navigate to the different sections using the navigation bar on the left.

# Introduction

Political Science is the scientific study of power and governance. Many non-social scientists often think of Political Science as philosophy, as debating the current political issues and campaigns. However, this couldn't be further from the truth.

<br />

Political Science today is a very quantitative and mathematical discipline: open any Political Science Academic Journal, and you could mistake it for an applied statistics or mathematics journal. Political scientists today frequently use mathematical models to create causal hypotheses, and advanced statistical/econometric techniques to prove our causal hypotheses.

<br />

This handbook is a guide to Political Science, focusing on modern quantitative methodology and its applications to Political Science Research. I take a very "political-economy" based approach - using more quantitative tools from the discipline of economics, to study political phenomena.

<br />

This handbook is divided into sections, which are further subdivided into modules, which are further subdivided into chapters. The first three sections focus on Political Science methods and how they work. The 4th section focuses on a variety of topics currently discussed in political science.

-   The final 5th section, on mathematics, is meant to be a supplementary section: It is not essential to know all the concepts in this section, but, it may be useful to reference to better understand the methods being used.

<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Section 1: Statistical Methods

This is a full course in statistics/econometrics, experimental design, and causal inference for Political Science.

-   The modules are meant to be learned in order, so later modules assume knowledge on earlier modules.

-   Other prerequisites and requirements are laid out in the respective modules.

-   The course primarily uses the R-programming language

-   Some math background from [Mathematics for Political Science](https://politicalscience.github.io/#mathematics-for-political-science) would be very useful

| Module | Chapters |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1 Introductory Statistical Theory | Basics of Probability, Random Variables, Statistical Inference, Difference in Means, Correlation |
| 2 Linear Regression Analysis | Simple Linear Regression, Different Types of Explanatory Variables, Assumptions and Model Selection, Panel and Clustered Data |
| 3 Logistic Regression Analysis | Definition and Interpretation, Estimation and Inference, Ordinal and Multinomial Logistic Regression |
| 4 Causal Inference and Random Experiments | Causal Frameworks, Randomisation and Experiments |
| 5 Causal Inference for Observational Studies | Instrumental Variables, Selection on Observables, Differences-in-Differences, Regression Discontinuity |
| 6 Multivariate Dimensional Reduction | Principle Components Analysis, Factor Analysis, Cluster Analysis |
| 7 Multivariate Latent Variable Analysis | Latent Trait Models, Latent Class Models, Structural Equation Modelling |

<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Section 2: Applied Machine Learning

This course is about machine learning techniques employed in the social sciences.

-   The modules are meant to be learned in order, so later modules assume knowledge on earlier modules.

-   This course assumes knowledge up to the end of module 3 of [Statistics/Econometrics for Political Science](https://politicalscience.github.io/#statisticseconometrics-for-political-science)

-   Other prerequisites and requirements are laid out in the respective modules.

-   The course primarily uses the R-programming language

-   Some math background from [Mathematics for Political Science](https://politicalscience.github.io/#mathematics-for-political-science) would be very useful

| Module | Chapters |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1 Non-Linear Prediction Models | Polynomial Models, Step Functions and Splines, Local Linear Regression, Generalised Additive Models, Bagging and Random Forest |
| 2 Classification Methods | Naive Bayes Classifier, Tree-Based Classifier, Evaluation of Classification Models |
| 3 Model Selection and Validation | Training and Testing Sets, K-Fold Cross Validation, Bootstrap Sampling, Regularisation |
| 4 Multivariate Dimensional Reduction | Principle Components Analysis, Factor Analysis, Cluster Analysis |
| 5 Text Mining | Text Analysis Basics, Sentiment Analysis, Similarity Metrics, Text-Based Classification, Topic Models |

<br />

# Section 3: Game Theory and Mathematical Modelling

Game Theory is the mathematical modelling of decision making, and is key to political science and other social sciences. This is a course for Game Theory and its uses in Political Science

-   The modules are meant to be learned in order, so later modules assume knowledge on earlier modules.

-   Other prerequisites and requirements are laid out in the respective modules.

-   Some math background from [Mathematics for Political Science](https://politicalscience.github.io/#mathematics-for-political-science) would be very useful

| Module | Chapters |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1 Static Games | Introduction to Game Theory, Nash Equilibrium and Static Games, Spatial Models, Mixed Strategies |
| 2 Dynamic Games | Dynamic Games of Complete Information, Imperfect and Incomplete Information, Bayesian Games |
| 3 Advanced Games | Nim and Combinatorial Games, Bimatrix Games |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Section 4: Topics in Political Science

<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Section 5: Mathematics for Political Science

This is an important module that establishes the foundations in which other methods build on

-   This course assumes some familiarity with high school level mathematics

-   This course is often very useful, if not essential, to understanding the quantitative methods used in Political Science

| Module | Chapters |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| [1 Topics in Algebra](https://politicalscience.github.io/mathematics/1.html) | Set Theory, Algebra Fundamentals, Exponents & Logarithms, Sum & Product Notation, Functions, Limits & Continuity |

# About the Author {#creator}

This handbook was created by Kevin Lingfeng Li, in Quarto (the new version of R-Markdown)!

-   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlingfengli/)

I am a candidate for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economy at the London School of Economics (LSE), focusing on Applied Statistical Methodology. Prior to my Masters, I completed a BSc in Politics at King's College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. During my Undergraduate Degree, I also took classes in Data Science + Machine Learning and Accounting at the London School of Economics.

I created this page as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that it would be useful for me, and for my fellow students, to have a collection of Political Science resources in one place.

I do my best to update this handbook: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.

# Resources for Learning Statistics and R-Programming {#resources}

-   For those who need an introduction to statistics, I recommend the **Khan Academy** course on AP Stats for a mathematical introduction: <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics>

-   There is also a terrific free textbook on **Statistical learning with applications to R**: <https://www.statlearning.com>

-   **BurkeyAcademy** provides free online econometrics courses and implementations in R: <https://www.burkeyacademy.com/statistics-econometrics>

-   For more advanced individuals who want to learn more in-depth about statistics, see this excellent **MIT lecture series**: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61ATaGTFcSp7bhogloD2wHP>

-   A free resource to learn R with is **CodeAcademy**: <https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-r>

-   For those who have spare cash to spend, there is an excellent R programming course **(Data Analysis with R) offered by IBM on Coursera**, which teaches R and statistics: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-r>

-   I also highly recommend those who can afford it, to attend the **London School of Economic (LSE) Summer School**, which has an excellent course - **ME314 Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning**. Many of these methods are covered in depth in this course, and the course is run by one of the developers of Quanteda, the main textual-analysis R package.
