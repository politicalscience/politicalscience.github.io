This is a collection of resources relating to Political Science and Political Economy, that I have gathered during my masters degree at LSE.

# Quantitative Methods (Causal Inference)

This section is about methods of identifying and measuring the size of causal effects in both experimental and observational settings for political science (and other social sciences).

See the section on Statistical Models and Mathematics below if you need a refresher.

1.  [Background: Introductory Econometric Theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/0.html)
2.  [Causal Frameworks and Estimands](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/1.html)
3.  [Randomised Experiments](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/2.html)
4.  [Selection on Observables](https://politicalscience.github.io/causal/3.html)
5.  Instrumental Variables
6.  Regression Discontinuity
7.  Differences-in-Differences
8.  Synthetic Controls
9.  Causal Trees

Additionally, if you need ways to measure variables for causal analysis, the multivariate statistics part of the statistical models section below provides some resources for this.

# Topics in Political Science/Political Economy

This section contains a variety of topics in political science and political economy that I find interesting. These topics are explored using mostly game theory, but also some quantitative methods (causal inference) as well.

0.  [Background: Guide to Game Theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/topics/0.html)
1.  [Elections and Policy Competition](https://politicalscience.github.io/topics/1.html)
2.  [The Uses of Elections](https://politicalscience.github.io/topics/2.html)
3.  The Rise of Populism
4.  Democratic Backsliding
5.  The Prisoner's Dilemma and Potential for Cooperation
6.  Legislative Bargaining and Institutional Design
7.  Politics of Conflict

*Content in this section is taken from GV482 Current Issues, GV325 Topics in Political Economy, and GV4C8 Game Theory.*

Also, a [quick guide to game theory](https://politicalscience.github.io/topics/0.html).

## Additional and Supplementary Materials

## Statistical Models

Note! Statistical models do not show causality! You need a causal identification strategy to identify causal effects (see the above section on causal inference).
