## Navigating the Collection

Use the **left sidebar** for navigation between topics. Use the **right sidebar** to navigate within a topic. There is also a **search bar** on the left sidebar if you need it.

This collection is best used with a computer, as the layout is more optimised. For mobile users, there should be a button on the top-left to access the navigation sidebar.

## Topics in this Collection

1.  **Quantitative Methods for Causal Inference**. R-code is provided for implementation.
2.  Other Materials, including a **Guide to Game Theory**, and some **Supplementary Mathematics**.
3.  **Further Statistical Models** (other regressions, multivariate latent models, etc.). R-code is provided for implementation purposes.

I am continuously updating the resources here, so things may not be 100% complete.
