# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a collection of resources and notes for political science and political economy that I have collected throughout my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.

I include resources on theoretical statistics, applied statistics, game theory, and mathematics. This is not meant to be a course - just resources and notes to refresh content.

I am continuously adding more to this collection as a learn more. Some parts may be incomplete, and you may see some changes in existing parts.

# Notation

I will use a variety of notation in this guide. I will do my best to remain consistent with the notation throughout all chapters.

For common statistical operators, I denote them as following:

-   Probability $\P(\cdot)$.
-   Expectation $\E(\cdot)$.
-   Variance $\V(\cdot)$.
-   Covariance $Cov(\cdot, \cdot)$.

Random variables will typically be denoted by an uppercase letter, for example $X$. A realisation of this variable (for example, in a sample), will be denoted with lowercase $x$.

I will use matrices and vectors frequently in this guide. Matrices are denoted with a bold capital letter $\b X$, and vectors are denoted with a bold lowercase letter $\b x$. Transposes will be denoted $\b X^\top$.

To be very clear regarding probability density functions and cumulative density functions, I will always specify the variable in question as a subscript, for example, $f_Y(y)$ and $F_Y(y)$.

For indexes related to random variables and samples, I have made a few notational choices.

-   For observation of a sample/population, I will use index $t$ to refer to a specific observation (Ex. $Y_t$), no matter if it is cross-sectional or time series data. This choice is consistent with Amemiya's notation.
-   For number of parameters in a model, I will use $p$ (ex. $X_p$), which is the standard in statistics. However, econometricians will often use $k$ to refer to the number of parameters.
