### Welcome to my notes for Stats (and other methods) in Political Science

This is a collection of materials and information on political science topics and methods that I have compiled over my years of studying political science. This website consists of notes on 8 courses and 1 workshop, each covering a different topic in political science methodology.

<br />

I am posting these notes on this page as a helpful resource for myself, classmates, and others. I try to make my notes clear so they are understandable.

<br />

These notes are the "nicer" versions that I subsequently shortened to include key content - they are not the original notes in which I took during lectures. I will update these as I learn new content.

# Workshop: R Fundamentals (not complete) {#r}

*R is a programming language that is commonly used for statistics and data science, particularly in academia. This section will have some R guides on some fundamental techniques needed for the other courses.*

*This course is not meant to be a complete and full introduction to R. It is best to view this course as a reference guide after you have the basics of R down. [Resources for learning R](#resources).*

Prerequisites: none.

# About the Creator {#creator}

This handbook was created by Kevin Lingfeng Li, in R-Markdown!

-   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlingfengli/)

I am a candidate for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economy at the London School of Economics (LSE), focusing on Applied Statistical Methodology. Prior to my Masters, I completed a BSc in Politics at King's College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. During my Undergraduate Degree, I also took classes in Data Science + Machine Learning and Accounting at the London School of Economics.

I created this page as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that it would be useful for me, and for my fellow students, to have a collection of Political Science resources in one place.

I do my best to update this handbook: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.

# Resources for Learning Statistics and R-Programming {#resources}

-   For those who need an introduction to statistics, I recommend the **Khan Academy** course on AP Stats for a mathematical introduction: <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics>

-   There is also a terrific free textbook on **Statistical learning with applications to R**: <https://www.statlearning.com>

-   **BurkeyAcademy** provides free online econometrics courses and implementations in R: <https://www.burkeyacademy.com/statistics-econometrics>

-   For more advanced individuals who want to learn more in-depth about statistics, see this excellent **MIT lecture series**: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61ATaGTFcSp7bhogloD2wHP>

-   A free resource to learn R with is **CodeAcademy**: <https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-r>

-   For those who have spare cash to spend, there is an excellent R programming course **(Data Analysis with R) offered by IBM on Coursera**, which teaches R and statistics: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-r>

-   I also highly recommend those who can afford it, to attend the **London School of Economic (LSE) Summer School**, which has an excellent course - **ME314 Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning**. Many of these methods are covered in depth in this course, and the course is run by one of the developers of Quanteda, the main textual-analysis R package.
