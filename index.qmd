This is a collection of materials and information on political science quantitative methods that I have compiled over my years of studying political science.

-   The handbook is divided into sections, each providing detailed information on topics relevant to Political Science

This handbook is best used on a laptop. Navigate to the different sections using the navigation bar on the left.

# Preface

Political Science is the scientific study of power and governance. Many non-social scientists often think of Political Science as philosophy, as debating the current political issues and campaigns. However, this couldn't be further from the truth.

Political Science today is a very quantitative and mathematical discipline: open any Political Science Academic Journal, and you could mistake it for an applied statistics or mathematics journal. Political scientists today frequently use mathematical models to create causal hypotheses, and advanced statistical/econometric techniques to prove our causal hypotheses.

This handbook is a guide to Political Science, focusing on modern quantitative methodology and its applications to Political Science Research. I take a very "political-economy" based approach - using more quantitative tools from the discipline of economics, to study political phenomena.

This handbook is divided into sections, which are further subdivided into modules, which are further subdivided into chapters. The first three sections focus on Political Science methods and how they work. The 4th section focuses on a variety of topics currently discussed in political science and political economy.

-   The final 5th section, on mathematics, is meant to be a supplementary section: It is not essential to know all the concepts in this section, but, it may be useful to reference to better understand the methods being used.

These sections do not have to be done in order, with the exception that it is highly recommended to do some of section 1 (modules 1 & 2) before section 2. You also do not need to complete all the modules in a section - each section takes you to a postgraduate level, which may be beyond what is needed for your interests.

# Section 1: Statistical Methods

Statistics is the backbone of modern Political Science and Political Economy. Why is this the case? In political science, we are often interested in relationships between variables. How does democracy affect economic growth? How do different voting systems affect women representation? Statistical tools allow us to describe the real world, and establish causal relationships.

This is a full course in statistics/econometrics, experimental design, and causal inference for Political Science. Section 1 introduces basic statistical concepts, while Section 2 and 3 discuss the most common regression models used in Political Science research. Section 4 introduces ways in which we can establish causality in our research. Sections 5 and 6 are advanced (rarely covered in undergraduate programmes), but help deal with some more advanced topics in political science.

The modules are meant to be learned in order, so later modules assume knowledge on earlier modules. Other prerequisites and requirements are laid out in the respective modules. The course primarily uses the R-programming language to create models. Some math background from [Mathematics for Political Science](https://politicalscience.github.io/#section-5-mathematics-for-political-science) would be very useful, especially up to the end of Module 3.

| Module | Chapters |

# Section 2: Applied Machine Learning

In recent decades, Political Science has increasingly adopted machine learning techniques. These more advanced and complex techniques, while reducing the ability to interpret the results, allow us to make quite accurate predictions. Machine learning has also enabled the conversion of text-based data into numerical numbers, allowing us to conduct statistical analyses on text data.

This course is about machine learning techniques employed in the social sciences. The modules are meant to be learned in order, so later modules assume knowledge on earlier modules. This course assumes knowledge up to the end of module 3 of [Statistical Methods](https://politicalscience.github.io/#section-1-statistical-methods). Other prerequisites and requirements are laid out in the respective modules. The course primarily uses the R-programming language. Some math background from [Mathematics for Political Science](https://politicalscience.github.io/#section-5-mathematics-for-political-science) would be very useful, especially up to the end of Module 3.

| Module | Chapters |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1 Non-Linear Prediction Models | Polynomial Models, Step Functions and Splines, Local Linear Regression, Generalised Additive Models, Bagging and Random Forest |
| 2 Classification Methods | Naive Bayes Classifier, Tree-Based Classifier, Evaluation of Classification Models |
| 3 Model Selection and Validation | Training and Testing Sets, K-Fold Cross Validation, Bootstrap Sampling, Regularisation |
| 4 Multivariate Dimensional Reduction | Principle Components Analysis, Factor Analysis, Cluster Analysis |
| 5 Text Mining | Text Analysis Basics, Sentiment Analysis, Similarity Metrics, Text-Based Classification, Topic Models |

# Section 3: Game Theory and Mathematical Modelling

Game Theory is the mathematical modelling of political situations and decision making. Why do we want to model political situations? Well, the world is very, very complex, especially when we are studying human behaviour as in the social sciences. Thus, models simplify reality, and focus on only some features of reality that we care about. These models can provide insights for scholars in the social sciences, and help decision makers.

This is a full course in Game Theory for Political Science. Thus, we focus on the political science applications of game theory, while de-emphasising mathematical proofs, and avoiding concepts that are not applicable to Political Science.

The modules are meant to be learned in order, so later modules assume knowledge on earlier modules. Other prerequisites and requirements are laid out in the respective modules. Some probability background is useful, so module 1 of [Statistical Methods](https://politicalscience.github.io/#section-1-statistical-methods) is recommended as a pre-requisite. Some math background from [Mathematics for Political Science](https://politicalscience.github.io/#section-5-mathematics-for-political-science) would be very useful, especially up to module 3.

| Module | Chapters |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1 Static Games | Introduction to Game Theory, Nash Equilibrium and Static Games, Spatial Models, Mixed Strategies |
| 2 Dynamic Games | Dynamic Games of Complete Information, Imperfect and Incomplete Information, Bayesian Games |
| 3 Advanced Games | Nim and Combinatorial Games, Bimatrix Games |

# Section 4: Political Science & Political Economy

Of course, having a strong base in methodology is very important - how else are you going to understand research papers? However, methodology is only a tool - a tool to help us understand and explore phenomena in Political Science.

This section has a series of modules on different aspects of Political Science. There is no pre-requisites to this course - even someone with minimal methodological training can learn much from these modules. However, a strong understanding of methodology will be very useful in understanding how the conclusions presented in this module were obtained.

| Module | Chapters |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1 Elections and Institutions | Information Aggregation, Electoral Competition, Media, Social Media, Interest Groups, Populism |
| 2 Political Agency and Outcomes | Political Agency, Institutions and Policy Outcomes |
| 3 Politics in Developing Countries | Corruption, State Capacity |
| 4 Autocratic Politics & Democratisation | Elite Behaviour, Role of Parliament, Role of Media, Democratisation |
| 5 Comparative Political Economy | States and Markets, Varieties of Capitalism, Welfare States |

# Section 5: Mathematics for Political Science

This section is mostly a supplemental section to the other modules. This section contains most of the mathematics that are needed for the methods utilised in this handbook. If you need a refresher on any of the mathematics involved, this is the place to reference.

While it may be possible to learn mathematics from this section, this isn't the goal of this section. There is no practice problems, and practice is essential for learning maths. This section mainly is a refresher for concepts relevant to Political Science.

| Module | Chapters |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| [1 Topics in Algebra](https://politicalscience.github.io/mathematics/1.html) | Set Theory, Algebra Fundamentals, Sum & Product Notation, Functions, Limits & Continuity |
| [2 Single Variable Calculus](https://politicalscience.github.io/mathematics/2.html) | Derivatives, Partial Derivative, Optimisation, Integrals |
| 3 Vectors and Matrices | Vector Algebra, Matrix Algebra, Matrix Determinant, Matrices and OLS |
| 4 Vector Spaces and Systems of Equations |  |
| 5 Eigenvalues and Markov Chains |  |

# About the Author {#creator}

This handbook was created by Kevin L. Li

-   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlingfengli/)

I am a candidate for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economy at the London School of Economics (LSE), focusing on Applied Statistics/Econometrics. Prior to my Masters, I completed a BSc in Politics at King's College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. During my Undergraduate Degree, I also took classes in Data Science + Machine Learning and Accounting at the London School of Economics.

I created this page as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that it would be useful for me, and for my fellow students, to have a collection of Political Science resources in one place.

I do my best to update this handbook: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.
