## Introduction

This site is a set of notes on quantitative political science, primarily focusing on a mathematical/formal modelling approach (often called Political Economics). This site contains a series of formal models of political situations which help explore real-world political phenomena.

-   Note: the models in this guide require a knowledge of Game Theory/Microeconomics - specifically, the concepts of Nash Equilibrium, Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium, Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium, and Bayes' Rule.

I have divided this site into different sections on different topics within political science, including elections, democracies and institutions, and autocracies. Use the navigation bar on the side to navigate, or simply scroll up and down.

A companion to this guide is the [Statistics for Social Scientists Toolkit](https://statsnotes.github.io), which provides the statistical and econometric methods useful for political scientists interested in empirically testing theories.

## Electoral Politics

| Model                                                       | Description                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Median Voter Theory and Spatial Electoral Models            | *A collection of models that explores how political parties are incentivised to position themselves along the political spectrum.*       |
| The Public Goods Problem and the Possibility of Cooperation | *Models that explore the public goods/tragedy of the commons problem, and how these can be resolved with cooperation in repeated games.* |
| Tax Levels and Public Finance in Democracies                | *A model that shows how tax levels will differ in different countries, as a result of electoral politics.*                               |
| Elections as Tools to Incentivise Politicians               | *Models that explore how electoral design can be made so that the public can encourage politicians to do what is right.*                 |

## Democracies and Institutions

| Model                                                    | Description                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Open and Closed Rule Legislation and Institutional Power | *Models that show that in a committee-legislature situation, less power to the legislature actually results in better outcomes for the legislature.* |
| Budget Allocation and Institutional Features             | *Models that show how different institutional features can affect how politicians divide a budget between their constituencies*.                     |

## About the Author

This website was created by Kevin Lingfeng Li.

-   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlingfengli/) \| [Website](https://kevinli03.github.io/)
-   My other guide on [statistics for social scientists](https://statsnotes.github.io).

I am a candidate for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), focusing on Applied Statistics/Econometrics. Prior to my Masters, I completed a BSc in Politics at Kingâ€™s College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. During my Undergraduate Degree, I also took classes in Data Science + Machine Learning and Accounting at the London School of Economics.

I created this page as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that it would be useful for me, and for my fellow students, to have a collection of Political Science resources in one place.

I do my best to update this website: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.
