<p>This chapter introduces how elections can be useful tools in democracies for governance. We first look at a model of how elections can help voters select good candidates to govern. Then, we look at how elections can help decide tax policy and public goods. Finally, we look at how elections can be tools to aggregate information across all voters to achieve better outcomes.</p>

<h1><strong>Elections as Selection Devices</strong></h1>
<section id="a-model-of-political-agency" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-model-of-political-agency">A Model of Political Agency</h3>
<p>We have 3 players: a voter, and 2 politicians (an incumbent <span class="math inline">I</span> and a challenger <span class="math inline">C</span> ). Our model will take place over two time periods, <span class="math inline">t \in \{1, 2\}</span>.</p>
<p>Each time period <span class="math inline">t</span> will have a bad policy outcome, or a good policy outcome: <span class="math inline">w_t \in \{0, 1\}</span>. The probability of a good outcome depends both on the <strong>effort</strong> and <strong>competence</strong> of the elected politician in office during that time period.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Politicians <span class="math inline">j \in (I, C)</span> each can have high competence, or low competence: <span class="math inline">\theta \in \{ \theta_H, \theta_L \}</span>. The prior probability of any politician being competent is <span class="math inline">p \in (0, 1)</span>. Only the politician themselves know their own competence.</p>
<p>Politicians, if in office, can exert effort into making better policies. The sitting politician in period <span class="math inline">t</span> can exert no effort, or a lot of effort: <span class="math inline">e_t \in \{0, 1 \}</span>.</p>
<p>However, politicians in choosing to exert effort, will have some costs. The costs <span class="math inline">c</span> are some function of effort <span class="math inline">e_t</span> and type <span class="math inline">\theta</span>: <span class="math inline">c(e_t, \theta)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
&amp; \underbrace{c(0, \theta_H) = c(0, \theta_L) = 0}_{\text{cost of no effort is always }0} \\
&amp; \underbrace{c(1, \theta_H) = 1}_{\text{cost of effort for } \theta_H} \ &lt; \ \underbrace{c(1, \theta_L) = 2}_{\text{cost of effort for } \theta_L}
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>This is because more competent politicians will need less energy to achieve the same effort as low competence politicians, because of their competence.</p>
<p>The payoffs of politicians are given as a function of both <span class="math inline">R</span>, the utility they gain from being in office (given they win the election), and subtracting the costs of putting in effort <span class="math inline">c(e_t, \theta)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
u_j(e_1, e_2, \theta) = \gamma_{1j} (R - c(e_1, \theta)) + \gamma_{2j} (R - c(e_2, \theta))
</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\gamma_{tj}</span> indicates if in time period <span class="math inline">t</span>, the politician <span class="math inline">j \in \{I, C \}</span> (either incumbent or challenger) is in office. When <span class="math inline">\gamma_{tj} = 1</span>, the politician is in office, and when <span class="math inline">\gamma_{tj} = 0</span>, the politician is not in office.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>However, voters do not observe <strong>effort</strong> and <strong>competence</strong>. They only observe the outcome <span class="math inline">w_t</span> is good or bad. The probability <span class="math inline">\pi</span> of a good outcome <span class="math inline">w_t = 1</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\pi = Pr(w_t = 1) = \begin{bmatrix}
&amp; e_t = 0 &amp; e_t = 1 \\
\theta_L &amp; 0 &amp; 0.5 \\
\theta_H &amp; 0.5 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
</span></p>
<p>Or in other words, if a low-competence politician puts no effort, there is 0% chance of a good outcome. If a low-competence politician puts in effort, there is a 50% chance of a good outcome. If a high-competence politician puts in no effort, there is a 50% chance of a good outcome. If a high-competence politician puts in effort, there is a 100% chance of a good outcome.</p>
<p>Outcome is not a perfect indication of the politician’s actions or type, but a good outcome is indicative of either higher effort or high competence.</p>
<p>Voter’s utility is dependent on the policy outcomes - they want the best policy outcomes for themselves:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
u_i = w_1 + w_2
</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The timing of the game is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Nature draws the type of the incumbent politician and the challenger politician <span class="math inline">\theta = \theta_H, \theta_L</span>, at probability <span class="math inline">Pr(\theta = \theta_H) = p</span> for each politician.</li>
<li>Incumbent politician (already in office during <span class="math inline">t=1</span>) decides how much effort to exert in period 1 <span class="math inline">e_1 \in \{0, 1\}</span>.</li>
<li>Period 1 outcome <span class="math inline">w_1</span> is realised.</li>
<li>Voter either re-elects the incumbent, or elects the challenger based off of <span class="math inline">w_1</span>.</li>
<li>The elected politician (either incumbent if re-elected, or challenger) then decides how much effort to exert in period 2 <span class="math inline">e_2 \in \{0, 1\}</span>.</li>
<li>Period 2 outcome <span class="math inline">w_2</span> is realised.</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="voters-incentives" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="voters-incentives">Voter’s Incentives</h3>
<p>Since this is a dynamic game, we should start from the end of the game, time period <span class="math inline">t=2</span>. Based on the model, there is no election after period 2 (the world essentially ends).</p>
<p>We know that politicians exert some cost <span class="math inline">c(e_t, \theta)</span> when exerting effort. However, when there is no election after <span class="math inline">t=2</span>, there is no incentive to exert any cost. Thus, the only rational strategy for any politician <span class="math inline">j</span> is to exert effort <span class="math inline">e_2</span> = 0.</p>
<p>What happens when effort <span class="math inline">e_2 = 0</span> is realised? If the politician in the 2nd round is type <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span>, then there is a 50% chance of a good outcome, which gives the voter an expected utility of <span class="math inline">w_2 = \frac{1}{2} (1)</span>. When the politician in the 2nd round is type <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span>, then there is a 50% chance of a bad outcome, which gives the voter an expected utility of <span class="math inline">w_2 = 0</span>.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the voter gets a higher expected utility in <span class="math inline">t=2</span> if the politician who occupies office in <span class="math inline">t=2</span> is type <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span>. Thus, the goal of the voter now becomes to elect a <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span> politician in the election before <span class="math inline">t=2</span>.</p>
<p>Voters thus have 4 possible strategies to pursue:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Re-elect only when outcome in period 1 is good: <span class="math inline">w_1 = 1</span>.</li>
<li>Re-elect only when outcome in period 1 is bad: <span class="math inline">w_0 = 0</span>.</li>
<li>Never re-elect no matter the outcome in period 1.</li>
<li>Always re-elect no matter the outcome in period 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Strategies 3 and 4 is never rational, and I will not provide the full proof here. The simple reason is that if you always re-elect or never re-elect regardless of outcome, then neither candidate has any incentive to put any effort, since they know they will 100% be re-elected or not-elected.</p>
<p>Strategy 2 can be rational in certain circumstances (which is counterintuitive), but again, this is not particularly useful for the purposes of this model.</p>
<p>For the rest of the time, we will focus on strategy 1: voter only re-elects the incumbent if they see a good outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 1</span> in <span class="math inline">t=1</span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="incumbents-decision" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="incumbents-decision">Incumbent’s Decision</h3>
<p>We are assuming that the voter only re-elects the incumbent if they see a good outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 1</span> in <span class="math inline">t=1</span>. This implies that the probability of re-election for the incumbent <span class="math inline">I</span> is equal to the probability of a good outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 1</span> in the first period <span class="math inline">t = 1</span>.</p>
<p>We know that a politician’s utility is given by the following utility function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
u_j(e_1, e_2, \theta) = \gamma_{1j} (R - c(e_1, \theta)) + \gamma_{2j} (R - c(e_2, \theta))
</span></p>
<p>Let us look at the incumbent’s <span class="math inline">j = C</span> decisions in <span class="math inline">t=1</span>. Should the exert effort or not? Let us test all four combinations of competence type <span class="math inline">\theta</span> and effort level <span class="math inline">e_1</span>.</p>
<p>If the incumbent is <span class="math inline">\theta_L</span>, and he exerts no effort <span class="math inline">e_1=0</span>, what happens? The incumbent will not have any cost <span class="math inline">c( 0, \theta_L) =0</span>, since they are exerting no effort. But they will have 0% probability of producing a good outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 0</span>, so they will never be re-elected. Thus, we know that <span class="math inline">\gamma_{2j} = 0</span>, since they will never be in office in the second period. Thus, their utility is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
u_I(0,0, \theta_L) = 1 (R - 0) + 0 (R - c(e_2, \theta)) = R
</span></p>
<p>If the incumbent is type <span class="math inline">\theta_L</span>, but he exerts effort, he has a cost <span class="math inline">c(1, \theta_L) = 1</span>, but also has a 50% chance of being re-elected to the second round (where no politician puts any effort, as seen above). Thus, his utility is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
u_I(1,0, \theta_L) = 1(R - 2) + \frac{1}{2}(R - 0) = R - 2 + \frac{1}{2}R
</span></p>
<p>So, when should incumbent type <span class="math inline">\theta_L</span> use effort <span class="math inline">e_1 = 1</span>? Only when the payoff of <span class="math inline">e_1 = 1</span> is higher. Thus, we have the following inequality, and we can find the condition of <span class="math inline">R</span> that makes it so type <span class="math inline">\theta_L</span> wants to exert effort in <span class="math inline">t=1</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
&amp; u_I(1, 0, \theta_L) &gt; u_I(0, 0, \theta_L) \\
&amp; R - 2 + \frac{1}{2}R &gt; R \\
&amp; R &gt; 4
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>Thus, incumbent with type <span class="math inline">\theta_L</span> only wants to put in effort <span class="math inline">e_1 = 1</span> in <span class="math inline">t=1</span> if <span class="math inline">R&gt;4</span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now let us do the same for <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span>. If he puts in no effort <span class="math inline">e_1 = 0</span>, he has a 50% chance of getting a good outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 1</span>, and thus, a 50% of winning reelection. The utility is thus:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
u_I(0, 0, \theta_H) = 1(R-0) + \frac{1}{2}(R-0) = \frac{3}{2}R
</span></p>
<p>If type <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span> puts in effort <span class="math inline">e_1 = 1</span>, he has a 100% chance of getting a good outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 1</span>, and a 100% chance of winning reelection. Thus, the utility is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
u_I(1, 0, \theta_H) = 1(R - 1) + 1(R-0) = 2R - 1
</span></p>
<p>So, when should incumbent type <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span> use effort <span class="math inline">e_1 = 1</span>? Only when the payoff of <span class="math inline">e_1 = 1</span> is higher. Thus, we have the following inequality, and we can find the condition of <span class="math inline">R</span> that makes it so type <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span> wants to exert effort in <span class="math inline">t=1</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
&amp; u_I(1, 0, \theta_H) ≥ u_I(0, 0, \theta_H) \\
&amp; 2R - 1 &gt; \frac{3}{2}R \\
&amp; R &gt;2
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>Thus, incumbent with type <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span> only wants to put in effort <span class="math inline">e_1 = 1</span> in <span class="math inline">t=1</span> if <span class="math inline">R&gt;2</span>.</p>
<p>We can create a graph of when the incumbents want to exert effort <span class="math inline">e_1 = 1</span> given the value of <span class="math inline">R</span>:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>We can see there are three different scenarios:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>When <span class="math inline">R&lt;2</span>, both types have no incentive to put any effort.</li>
<li>When <span class="math inline">R \in (2, 4)</span>, only competent type <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span> have an incentive to put in effort.</li>
<li>When <span class="math inline">R &gt; 4</span>, both types have incentives to put in effort.</li>
</ol>

<section id="voters-electoral-decision" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="voters-electoral-decision">Voter’s Electoral Decision</h3>
<p>We discussed above how there are the 3 different scenarios given the value of <span class="math inline">R</span>. Let us test each scenario. We also assumed that the voter will re-elect if there is a good outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 1</span> in period <span class="math inline">t=1</span>, and not re-elect if there is a bad outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 0</span>.</p>
<p>Is this assumption of the strategy for the voter rational? Let us test each of the 3 scenarios given <span class="math inline">R</span> to see if this strategy is rational for the voter. To do this, we will be using Bayes’ Rule.</p>

</span></p>
<p>This will allow us to take our prior beliefs (such as the initial probability of high-competence), and update them given new information (like witnessing a good/bad policy outcome).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Remember that nature decides the type of the incumbent and challenger with prior probability <span class="math inline">p</span> of being high competence <span class="math inline">\theta_h</span>. Let us also remind us the probability of a good outcome, <span class="math inline">\pi = Pr(w_t = 1)</span>, given the type and effort of the incumbent:</p>
<p><span class="math display">

<p>Let us assume we are in the situation <span class="math inline">R&lt;2</span>, where neither play puts effort.

<p>Thus, we know that given we observe a bad outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 0</span>, there is a <span class="math inline">\frac{p}{2-p}</span> probability that the incumbent is type high competence <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span>. We know that the challenger has the possibility of being <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span> with probability <span class="math inline">p</span>. Since:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\frac{p}{2-p} &lt; p \quad (\text{since } p \in (0, 1))
</span></p>
<p>That means that the challenger is more likely to be a high competence <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span> politician, which means the rational thing to do is to not re-elect, and instead elect the challenger.</p>
<p>We also know that if we observe a good outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 1</span>, there is a probability of <span class="math inline">1</span> that the incumbent is high-type. This is a higher probability than <span class="math inline">p \in (0, 1)</span>, the probability the challenger is high competence <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span>. Thus, if you observe a good outcome <span class="math inline">w_1</span>, you should re-elect the incumbent.</p>
<p>This matches with our assumption that voter will re-elect if there is a good outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 1</span> in period <span class="math inline">t=1</span>, and not re-elect if there is a bad outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 0</span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now, let us assume we are in the situation <span class="math inline">R\in (2, 4)</span>, where only the high competence type <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span> puts effort. We know that the voter wants to elect a high competence candidate <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span>. What is the probability of the candidate being <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span>, given the two possible outcomes <span class="math inline">w_1 \in \{0, 1\}</span>?</p>
<p><span class="math display">

<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
Pr(\theta_h | w_1 = 1) &amp; = \frac{\overbrace{Pr(w_1 = 1|\theta_H)}^{1 \text{ (given by } \pi)} \overbrace{Pr(\theta_H)}^{p \text{ (prior)}}}

</span></p>
<p>So we can see that if we observe <span class="math inline">w_1 = 0</span>, there is a 0% chance that the incumbent is high competence <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span>, so we should not re-elect and vote in the challenger. If we observe <span class="math inline">w_1 = 1</span>, there is a 100% chance that the incumbent is high competence <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span>, so we should re-elect. This matches with our assumption that voter will re-elect if there is a good outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 1</span> in period <span class="math inline">t=1</span>, and not re-elect if there is a bad outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 0</span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Finally, let us assume we are in the situation <span class="math inline">R&gt; 4</span>, where both types put effort.

What is the probability of the candidate being <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span>, given the two possible outcomes <span class="math inline">w_1 \in \{0, 1\}</span>?</p>
<p><span class="math display">

{\underbrace{Pr(w_1 = 1|\theta_H)Pr(\theta_H)}_{\text{same as numerator}} + \underbrace{Pr(w_1 = 1|\theta_L)}_{0.5 \text{ (given by } \pi)} \underbrace{Pr(\theta_L)}_{1-p \text{ (prior)}}} \\
&amp; = \frac{1p}{1p + 0.5(1-p)} = \frac{2p}{2p + 1 - p} = \frac{2p}{1+ p}
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>So we can see that if we observe <span class="math inline">w_1 = 0</span>, there is a 0% chance that the incumbent is high competence <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span>, so we should not re-elect and vote in the challenger. If we observe <span class="math inline">w_1 = 1</span>, there is a <span class="math inline">\frac{2p}{1+p} &gt; p</span> chance that the incumbent is high competence <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span>, so we should re-elect. This matches with our assumption that the voter will re-elect if there is a good outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 1</span> in period <span class="math inline">t=1</span>, and not re-elect if there is a bad outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 0</span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thus, the assumption that the voter will re-elect if there is a good outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 1</span> in period <span class="math inline">t=1</span>, and not re-elect if there is a bad outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 0</span> is indeed rational.</p>

<section id="interpretation-of-the-outcome" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interpretation-of-the-outcome">Interpretation of the Outcome</h3>
<p>Thus, we have found the equilibrium strategies of this game:</p>
<ul>
<li>For voters, they will only re-elect if they see a good outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 1</span>, and vote for the challgner if they see a bad outcome <span class="math inline">w_1 = 0</span>.</li>
<li>For the incumbent in the first round: if <span class="math inline">R &lt; 2</span>, then neither type will put effort, so <span class="math inline">e_1 = 0</span>. If <span class="math inline">R \in (2, 4)</span>, then only <span class="math inline">\theta_H</span> puts in effort. If <span class="math inline">R &gt; 4</span>, then both types put in effort. In the second round, all types of incumbents will put <span class="math inline">e_2 = 0</span> effort.</li>
<li>For the challenger, if they are elected for the second round, they will put <span class="math inline">e_2 = 0</span> effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>What does this equilibrium outcome tell us?</p>
<p>When the benefits of holding offices are low (<span class="math inline">R &lt; 2</span>), incumbents do not really value re-election. Thus incumbents will not put any effort into their jobs. Elections here fail to incentives politicians to work hard. Elections in this scenario do always screen out and vote out low competence politicians, but they sometimes also mistakenly vote out high competence politicians as well.</p>
<p>When the benefits of holding offices are intermediate (<span class="math inline">R \in (2, 4)</span>), only competent incumbents want to seek re-election and will put in effort. The cost of effort given the rewards of holding office are too high for low-competence incumbents, so they will not put in effort. Thus, elections here incentives good politicians. Elections also are able to perfectly screen politicians: low competence ones are always voted out, and high competence ones are always re-elected.</p>
<p>When the benefits of holding office are high (<span class="math inline">R &gt; 4</span>), all politicians are motivated to seek re-election, and all politicians put in effort. Election is able to always successful re-elect good politicians, but some bad politicians are also re-elected.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Essentially what we have shown is a trade-off between selection and incentives. When the benefits of holding office are high, politicians are incentivised to put in effort, however, this also means that some low competence individuals will be re-elected. When the benefits of holding office are low, politicians are not incentivsed to put in effort, but we can almost always vote out low-comeptence individuals.</p>
<p>This model shows how the benefits of holding office, such as pay, receiving gifts and lobbying, and power, can impact how politicians behave. There is often discussion around paying politicians too high of salaries. However, this model shows that paying higher salaries actually motivates politicians to put more effort.</p>

<section id="a-model-of-public-finance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-model-of-public-finance">A Model of Public Finance</h3>
<p>Elections can also be a way in which the amount of public goods provision can be decided, and the amount of taxes can be decided.</p>
<p>Let us say we have <span class="math inline">n</span> number of citizens. Each citizen <span class="math inline">i</span> is different from each other, with varying incomes <span class="math inline">y_i</span>. Citizens utility is derived of two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How much they consume privately, <span class="math inline">c_i</span> (like stuff they buy, food the eat, consumer spending).</li>
<li>Their benefit from public goods provided by the government. The government will provide <span class="math inline">g</span> amount of public goods, which will give the citizen <span class="math inline">H(g)</span> of utility, where <span class="math inline">H</span> is a function converting the amount of public goods <span class="math inline">g</span> into utility.</li>
</ol>
<p>The government provides an amount of the public good <span class="math inline">g ≥ 0</span>. However, they can only pay for it through taxes <span class="math inline">t \in [0, 1]</span> (we are assuming no borrowing for this model). Increasing taxes <span class="math inline">t</span> will decrease citizen’s income <span class="math inline">y_i</span>, which will reduce the amount they will be able to consumer <span class="math inline">c_i</span>. Let us assume that taxes are only used for public goods.</p>
<p>We can define the amount of public goods as <span class="math inline">g</span>, which will be equal to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\underbrace{ty_1 + ty_2 + \dots + ty_n}_{\text{taxes collected from all citizens}} = n t \bar y = g
</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\bar y</span> is the average income of all citizens. We will assume that the mean income <span class="math inline">\bar y</span> is greater than the median income <span class="math inline">y_m</span>, since income is almost always right-skewed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thus, the utility of any citizen <span class="math inline">i</span> is their utility from both private consumption and public goods:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
u_i = c_i + H(g)
</span></p>
<p>Private consumption <span class="math inline">c_i</span> of a citizen <span class="math inline">i</span>, will be defined as the amount of income remaining after taxes. We know that <span class="math inline">t y_i</span> is taxed, so <span class="math inline">(1-t)y_i</span> is untaxed income. Thus:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
c_i = (1-t)y_i
</span></p>
<p>We will also assume that the utility derived from the public good, <span class="math inline">H(g)</span>, has decreasing marginal utility. This means that adding more and more <span class="math inline">g</span> will always yield a higher utility, however, with each additional <span class="math inline">g</span>, the gain in utility is smaller.</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="citizens-maximum-utility" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="citizens-maximum-utility">Citizen’s Maximum Utility</h3>
<p>Now the question is, what amount of public good <span class="math inline">g</span> (which directly impacts taxes <span class="math inline">t</span> and private consumption <span class="math inline">c_i</span>), is the optimal amount which maximises each citizen’s utility?</p>
<p>Recall that citizen’s utility is <span class="math inline">u_i = c_i + H(g)</span>. We also defined <span class="math inline">c_i = (1-t)y_i</span>. Let us plug <span class="math inline">c_i</span> into the utility function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
u_i = (1-t)y_i + H(g)
</span></p>
<p>Recall that earlier, we derived that <span class="math inline">nt \bar y = g</span>. We can solve for <span class="math inline">t</span> to get <span class="math inline">t = \frac{g}{n \bar y}</span>. Now plugging that in to the utility function, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
u_i = \left(1 - \frac{g}{n \bar y} \right)y_i + H(g)
</span></p>
<p>We now have only one variable <span class="math inline">g</span> in our utility function, so <span class="math inline">u_i</span> is a function of <span class="math inline">g</span>. How do we find the maximum utility for any citizen <span class="math inline">i</span>? We can find the first order condition to maximise <span class="math inline">u_i(g)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
u_i(g) &amp; = \left(1 - \frac{g}{n \bar y} \right)y_i + H(g) \\
u_i(g) &amp; = y_i - \frac{y_i}{n \bar y}g + H(g) \\
u_i'(g) &amp; = 0 - \frac{y_i}{n \bar y} + H'(g) \\
u'_i(g) &amp; = -\frac{y_i}{n \bar y} + H'(g) \\
0 &amp; = -\frac{y_i}{n \bar y} + H'(g) \\
H'(g) &amp; =  \frac{y_i}{n \bar y}
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>So we know the maximisation of utility condition is <span class="math inline">H'(g) = \frac{y_i}{n \bar y}</span>. What does this tell us?</p>
<p>First, we know <span class="math inline">H(g)</span> has decreasing marginal utility, which means <span class="math inline">H'(g)</span> must be decreasing as <span class="math inline">g</span> increases (see blue line below). We also know by <span class="math inline">H'(g) = \frac{y_i}{n \bar y}</span>, that when <span class="math inline">y_i</span> increases, <span class="math inline">H'(g)</span> should also increase, and when <span class="math inline">y_i</span> decreases, <span class="math inline">H'(g)</span> decreases. We can put this in a graph:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/clipboard-3177160330.png" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img" style="width:60.0%"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Let us take two citizens, <span class="math inline">y^H</span>, who has a large income, and <span class="math inline">y_L</span>, who has a low income. For the high income person <span class="math inline">y^H</span>, the corresponding <span class="math inline">g^L</span> on the blue line is quite small. For the low income person <span class="math inline">y^L</span>, the corresponding <span class="math inline">g^H</span> on the blue line is quite large.</p>
<p>This makes sense: the higher income you are (the richer you are), you probably care less about public goods <span class="math inline">g</span>, and would rather have lower taxes that benefit you more. If you have a lower income, you would rather have more government services and public goods.</p>

</section>
<section id="electoral-model-and-conclusions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="electoral-model-and-conclusions">Electoral Model and Conclusions</h3>
<p>Now we know the maximisation of utility for each citizen <span class="math inline">i</span>, what about the level of public goods <span class="math inline">g</span> that is implemented in a country?</p>
<p>In a democratic country, elections decide the policy platforms. Let us have two candidates <span class="math inline">A</span> and <span class="math inline">B</span> who are competing on the amount of public goods provision, choosing positions <span class="math inline">p_A</span> and <span class="math inline">p_B</span> regarding how much <span class="math inline">g</span> to provide. The party who wins the majority of votes will implement their plan.</p>
<p>According to the downsian model, the median voter is the pivotal voter in which both candidates will converge to. Remember that the median voter has an income of <span class="math inline">y_m</span>. Thus, the maximisation of utility condition for the median voter is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
H'(g)  =  \frac{y_i}{n \bar y} = \frac{y_m}{n \bar y}
</span></p>
<p>Remember that a higher <span class="math inline">H'(g)</span> corresponds to a lower <span class="math inline">g</span>. What does the above equation tell us?</p>
<p>First, if <span class="math inline">y_m</span> is much smaller than <span class="math inline">\bar y</span>, then <span class="math inline">H'(g)</span> will decrease and <span class="math inline">g</span> will be higher. That means in a society with more skewed income distribution (where the mean income is significantly higher than the median) will have higher public good provision and higher taxes.</p>
<p>Second, a richer country on average would have a higher <span class="math inline">\bar y</span>. A higher <span class="math inline">\bar y</span> means a lower <span class="math inline">H'(g)</span>, and a larger <span class="math inline">g</span>. This thus means that richer countries on average should have larger public goods provisions and larger taxes.</p>
<p>The first prediction does not seem necessarily to be true. Many ultra-unequal countries with huge skews of income do not have strong welfare states, while more equal countries (like in many nordic countries) do have strong welfare systems.</p>
<p>The second prediction does seem to be more accurate. In general, the countries with the largest welfare systems and highest taxes are developed nations who have significantly higher average incomes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You might point out that these predictions depend on the assumption that the Downsian model is correct, and that indeed, politicians converge at the median voter. However, in the <a href="https://politicalscience.github.io/topics/1.html">last chapter</a>, we discussed how this convergence often does not occur.</p>
<p>However, even using another model, like the <a href="https://politicalscience.github.io/topics/1.html#voting-on-more-than-policy">Probabilistic Voting model</a>, we would still get a similar prediction. The probablistic model predicts divergence, but this divergence shifts relative to the positioning of the median voter. Thus, the 2 predictions we made would still apply to non-converging models of electoral competition.</p>

<h1><strong>Elections as Information Aggregators</strong></h1>
<section id="model-of-information-aggregation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-of-information-aggregation">Model of Information Aggregation</h3>
<p>Many scholars believe that democracy is about finding the “correct” policy (ex. Russeau’s Social Contract). The belief is that there is some true “will of the people” that will benefit everyone, and the goal of elections is to find this correct common good.</p>
<p>No one individually knows exactly what the correct policy is. However, some people have some idea of what it could be. Elections could then serve as a way to “pool” everyone’s information together to find the correct policy (ex. wisdom of the crowd), instead of relying on everyone’s individual model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let us say there are three voters in a country, <span class="math inline">i \in \{1, 2, 3\}</span>. They have to make a choice between two policies <span class="math inline">\{A, B\}</span>, and they will make this choice by majority vote.</p>
<p>There are two states of the world <span class="math inline">\theta \in \{\theta_A, \theta_B\}</span>. In world <span class="math inline">\theta_A</span>, policy <span class="math inline">A</span> is the correct policy, and in <span class="math inline">\theta_B</span>, policy <span class="math inline">B</span> is the correct policy.</p>
<p>The state of the world <span class="math inline">\theta \in \{\theta_A, \theta_B\}</span> is unknown. The voters only know that there is a probability <span class="math inline">\pi</span> of the state being <span class="math inline">\theta_A</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
&amp; Pr(\theta_A) = \pi \\
&amp; Pr(\theta_B) = 1-\pi
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>Before casting their ballot, each voter receives a signal <span class="math inline">s_i \in \{0, 1\}</span>. Signal <span class="math inline">0</span> suggests that policy <span class="math inline">A</span> is correct (suggests <span class="math inline">\theta_A</span>), and signal <span class="math inline">1</span> suggests policy <span class="math inline">B</span> is correct (suggests <span class="math inline">\theta_B</span>). The probability of receiving each signal is as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
&amp; Pr(s_i=0|\theta_A) = q^a &gt; \frac{1}{2} \\
&amp; Pr(s_i=1|\theta_B) = q^b &gt; \frac{1}{2}
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>Or in other words, there is more than a 50% chance that the signal a player receives is correct about the state of the world.</p>
<p>The payoffs for the players are as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
u_i = \begin{cases}
1 \quad \text{if correct policy is implemented} \\
0 \quad \text{if otherwise}
\end{cases}
</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The timing of the game is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Nature determines the state of the world <span class="math inline">\theta \in \{\theta_A, \theta_B\}</span> where <span class="math inline">Pr(\theta_A) = \pi</span>.</li>
<li>The signal <span class="math inline">s_i \in \{0, 1\}</span> is received by every voter.</li>
<li>All voters cast their votes for policy <span class="math inline">A</span> or <span class="math inline">B</span> simultaneously.</li>
<li>The policy that gets the most votes is implemented.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sincere voting is when each voter simply follows her signal. Under this assumption, the strategy of voter <span class="math inline">i \in \{1, 2, 3\}</span> would be:</p>

\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>Rationally, a voter should base their decision on their updated posterior beliefs. Thus, having recieved <span class="math inline">s_i = 0</span>, you should only follow the signal (which suggests <span class="math inline">\theta_A</span>), only if your posterior belief also suggests <span class="math inline">Pr(\theta_A| s_i = 0) &gt; Pr(\theta_B|s_i = 0)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
&amp; Pr(\theta_A|s_i = 0) &gt; Pr(\theta_B|s_i = 0) \\
&amp; Pr(\theta_A|s_i = 0) &gt; \underbrace{1 - Pr(\theta_A|s_i = 0)}_{\text{complement probability}} \\
&amp; \frac{q^a\pi}{q^a \pi + (1-q^b)(1-\pi)} \ &gt; \ 1- \frac{q^a\pi}{q^a \pi + (1-q^b)(1-\pi)} \\
&amp; q^a \pi \ &gt; \ q^a \pi + (1-q^b)(1-\pi) \left(1- \frac{q^a\pi}{q^a \pi + (1-q^b)(1-\pi)} \right) \\

&amp; \frac{q^a \pi}{1 - q^b} \ &gt; \ 1 - \pi \\
&amp; \frac{q^a}{1 - q^b} \ &gt; \ \frac{1 - \pi}{\pi} \\
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>Thus, voter <span class="math inline">i</span> should only sincerely follow their signal <span class="math inline">s_i = 0</span> if <span class="math inline">\frac{q^a}{1 - q^b} &gt; \frac{1 - \pi}{\pi}</span>.</p>
<p>We can also do the same with having received <span class="math inline">s_i = 1</span>, you should only follow the signal (which suggests <span class="math inline">\theta_B</span> if:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
&amp; Pr(\theta_B|s_i = 1) &gt; Pr(\theta_A|s_i = 1) \\
&amp; Pr(\theta_B|s_i = 1) &gt; \underbrace{1 - Pr(\theta_B|s_i = 1)}_{\text{complement probability}} \\
&amp; \frac{q^b(1-\pi)}{q^b(1- \pi) + (1-q^a)\pi} &gt; 1 - \frac{q^b(1-\pi)}{q^b(1- \pi) + (1-q^a)\pi} \\
&amp; q^b(1-\pi) \ &gt; \ q^b(1- \pi) + (1-q^a)\pi \left( 1 - \frac{q^b(1-\pi)}{q^b(1- \pi) + (1-q^a)\pi} \right) \\
&amp; q^b(1-\pi) \ &gt; \ q^b(1- \pi) + (1-q^a)\pi - q^b(1- \pi) \\
&amp; q^b(1-\pi) \ &gt; \ (1-q^a)\pi \\
&amp; \frac{q^b}{(1-q^a)} \ &gt; \ \frac{\pi}{(1-\pi)}
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>Thus, voter <span class="math inline">i</span> should only sincerely follow their signal <span class="math inline">s_i = 1</span> if <span class="math inline">\frac{q^b}{(1-q^a)} &gt;  \frac{\pi}{(1-\pi)}</span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thus, the rationality of sincerely voting (following your signal) depends on the probabilities of <span class="math inline">\pi</span>, <span class="math inline">q^b</span>, and <span class="math inline">q^a</span>.</p>
<p>For example, if <span class="math inline">\pi = \frac{1}{2}</span>, if you plug that in (and consider that <span class="math inline">q^a, q^b &gt; \frac{1}{2}</span>), sincere voting is always optimal at an individual level.</p>
<p>However, so far, we have only focused on each voter’s own signal. What about the other signals of other voters? These could also provide information that we have not yet considered.</p>

<p>Suppose voter 3 has received <span class="math inline">s_3=1</span>. They must decide how to vote.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If voters 1 and 2 both voted for <span class="math inline">B</span>, then their vote does not matter.</li>
<li>If voters 1 and 2 both voted for <span class="math inline">R</span>, then their vote does not matter.</li>
<li>Their vote only matters if voter 1 and 2 split their votes.</li>
</ol>
<p>This concept of being able to determine an election is called being <strong>pivotal</strong>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Being a pivotal voter provides information. After all, there is only one true state of the world <span class="math inline">\theta \in \{\theta_A, \theta_B\}</span>.</p>
<p>Let us say the state of the world is <span class="math inline">\theta_A</span>. What is the probability of the first 2 voters getting different signals? We know that probability of 2 independent events happening is their product. Thus:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
Pr(s_1 ≠ s_2 | \theta_A) = &amp; \ \underbrace{\left(Pr(s_1 = 0|\theta_A) Pr(s_2 = 1 | \theta_A)\right)}_{\text{probability that } s_1 = 0, \ s_2 = 1} \\
&amp; \qquad + \underbrace{\left(Pr(s_1 = 1|\theta_A) Pr(s_2 = 2 | \theta_A)\right)}_{\text{probability that } s_1 = 1, \ s_2 = 0} \\
= &amp; \ q^a(1-q^a) + (1-q^a) q^a \\
= &amp; \ 2q^a(1-q^a)
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>Now let us say the state of the world is <span class="math inline">\theta_B</span>. What is the probability of the first 2 voters getting different signals?</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
Pr(s_1 ≠ s_2 | \theta_B) = &amp; \ \underbrace{\left(Pr(s_1 = 0|\theta_B) Pr(s_2 = 1 | \theta_B)\right)}_{\text{probability that } s_1 = 0, \ s_2 = 1} \\
&amp; \qquad + \underbrace{\left(Pr(s_1 = 1|\theta_B) Pr(s_2 = 2 | \theta_B)\right)}_{\text{probability that } s_1 = 1, \ s_2 = 0} \\
= &amp; \  (1-q^b)q^b + q^b(1-q^b) \\
= &amp; \ 2q^b(1-q^b)
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>This is new information for voter 3 to take in. Before with Bayes’ rule, we only considered their own signal <span class="math inline">s_3</span>. Now, they have to consider the additional information of being pivotal.</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="strategic-voting" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategic-voting">Strategic Voting</h3>
<p>So if voter 3 is pivotal, that means they now have additional information beyond just the signal <span class="math inline">s_3</span> that they received. This means that this could affect their updated posterior belief in the state of the world.</p>
<p>For example, given voter 3 has recieved <span class="math inline">s_3 = 1</span> signal, what is their belief that the state of the world matches the signal (which implies <span class="math inline">\theta_B</span>)? I have shortened “pivotal” to “piv” in the equations below:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
Pr(\theta_B|s_3 = 1, \text{piv}) &amp; = \frac{\overbrace{q^b}^{\text{our info}} \times \overbrace{2q^b(1-q^b)}^{\text{other voters info}}}{\underbrace{q^b}_{\text{our}} \times \underbrace{2q^b(1-q^b)}_{\text{other voters}} + \underbrace{(1- q^a)}_{\text{our}} \times \underbrace{2q^a(1-q^a)}_{\text{other voters}}} \\
&amp; = \frac{2(q^b)^2(1-q^b)}{2(q^b)^2(1-q^b) + 2q^a(1-q^a)^2} \\
&amp; = \frac{2(q^b)^2(1-q^b)}{2 \left[(q^b)^2(1-q^b) + q^a(1-q^a)^2 \right]} \\
&amp; = \frac{(q^b)^2(1-q^b)}{(q^b)^2(1-q^b) + q^a(1-q^a)^2} \\
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>Thus, voter 3 should vote for <span class="math inline">B</span> after <span class="math inline">s_i = 3</span> if their updated posterior belief is that <span class="math inline">\theta_B</span> is more likely:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
&amp; \frac{(q^b)^2(1-q^b)}{(q^b)^2(1-q^b) + q^a(1-q^a)^2} ≥ \frac{1}{2} \\
&amp; (q^b)^2(1-q^b) ≥  \frac{(q^b)^2(1-q^b) + q^a(1-q^a)^2}{2} \\
&amp; 2(q^b)^2(1-q^b) ≥ (q^b)^2(1-q^b) + q^a(1-q^a)^2 \\
&amp; (q^b)^2(1-q^b) ≥ q^a(1-q^a)^2  \\
&amp; \frac{(q^b)^2(1-q^b)}{q^a(1-q^a)^2} ≥ 1 \\
&amp; \frac{1-q^b}{q^a} \left( \frac{q^b}{1-q^a}\right)^2 ≥ 1 \\
&amp; \underbrace{\left( \frac{q^b}{1-q^a}\right)}_{\text{3's signal}} \underbrace{\frac{1-q^b}{q^a}\left( \frac{q^b}{1-q^a}\right)}_{\text{other signals given pivotal}} ≥ 1
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>That is the condition for which voter 3 should vote sincerely following their signal <span class="math inline">s_3 = 1</span>.</p>
<p>This condition can be violated. For example, let us suppose <span class="math inline">q^a = 0.6</span>, and <span class="math inline">q^b = 0.9</span>. We can plug it into the formula above:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\left(\frac{0.9}{1-0.6}\right) \frac{1-0.9}{0.6}\left(\frac{0.9}{1-0.6}\right) = 0.84 &lt; 1
</span></p>
<p>Thus, given these probabilities, sincere voting is not optimal for voter 3 if they recieve <span class="math inline">s_3 = 1</span>. Instead, voter 3 should vote against their signal, and vote for <span class="math inline">A</span>.</p>
<p>Why is this the case? Well remember, <span class="math inline">q^a</span> is the likelihood of recieving the correct signal <span class="math inline">s-i = 0</span> in world <span class="math inline">\theta_A</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
Pr(s_i=0|\theta_A) = q^a = 0.6
</span></p>
<p>What does that imply? That means if the world is truly <span class="math inline">\theta_A</span>, there is a 40% chance of receiving the wrong signal (i.e.&nbsp;signal <span class="math inline">s_i = 1</span>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, with <span class="math inline">q^b = 0.9</span>, that means that if the world was <span class="math inline">\theta_B</span>, there is only a 10% of recieving the wrong signal (i.e.&nbsp;signal <span class="math inline">s_i = 0</span>).</p>
<p>Thus, because we know the other two voters got different signals, we know one voter got a wrong signal, and that is far more likely that this resulted from state of the world <span class="math inline">\theta_A</span>. When incorporating this information with our own signal <span class="math inline">s_3</span>, we realise that the state of the world being <span class="math inline">\theta_A</span> is more Kelly.</p>
<p><br></p>

<section id="interpretation-of-result" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interpretation-of-result">Interpretation of Result</h3>
<p>The idea of this is that majority rule allows voters to aggregate information. If everyone was just voting on their own signals (i.e.&nbsp;their own knowledge about the world), the chances of getting the wrong policy are high.</p>
<p>However, in majority rule, by viewing other people’s information, we can take that information to make a better understanding of our own information.</p>
<p>However, all of this discussion relies on one key assumption: that there is a correct policy, and the goal of democracy is to find that policy.</p>
<p>Many scholars disagree with the idea of a “correct policy” for everyone. Some believe democracy is more about ideological conflict, while others believe it is more about selecting the right representatives.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that this idea of elections is completely useless. Some cases, like criminal trials, civil trials, or academic misconduct meetings, will also involve voting by members/juries/citizens. For these cases, there are likely a more realistic notion of a “correct” decision.</p>
