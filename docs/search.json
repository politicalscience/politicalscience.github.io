    "text": "Preface\nThis is a collection of resources and notes on statistics for political science that I have collected throughout my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.\nThe first part of this collection is regarding statistical theory of inference and estimators. We start with the some basic statistics in the form of distributions and random variables, as well as the basics of statistical inference. Then, we cover a series of estimators, starting with OLS, and expanding out. Finally, we cover some concepts in subfields of statistics, including causal identification and multivariate statistics.\nThe second part of the collection is more applied - showing how methods can be implemented for prediction and causal inference. We introduce different types of models, and how we can implement them with R code. If you are already comfortable with statistical theory, you can probably skip ahead to these applied chapters, and refer to the statistical theory chapters as references.\nFor the content in this guide, I assume some experience with basic statistics, such as a basic idea of sampling and statistical inference. I will review many of these concepts in the first two chapters. I also assume strong mathematical fundamentals, including calculus, linear algebra, and basic probability. There is some supplementary material provided in the appendix.\nI am continuously adding more to this collection as a learn more. Some parts may be incomplete, and you may see some changes in existing parts.\n\n\n\nNotation\nI will use a variety of notation in this guide. I will do my best to remain consistent with the notation throughout all chapters.\nFor common statistical operators, I denote them as following:\n\nProbability \\(\\P(\\cdot)\\).\nExpectation \\(\\E(\\cdot)\\).\nVariance \\(\\V(\\cdot)\\).\nCovariance \\(Cov(\\cdot, \\cdot)\\).\n\nRandom variables will typically be denoted by an uppercase letter, for example \\(X\\). A realisation of this variable (for example, in a sample), will be denoted with lowercase \\(x\\).\nI will use matrices and vectors frequently in this guide. Matrices are denoted with a bold capital letter \\(\\b X\\), and vectors are denoted with a bold lowercase letter \\(\\b x\\). Transposes will be denoted \\(\\b X^\\top\\).\nTo be very clear regarding probability density functions and cumulative density functions, I will always specify the variable in question as a subscript, for example, \\(f_Y(y)\\) and \\(F_Y(y)\\).\nFor indexes related to random variables and samples, I have made a few notational choices.\n\nFor observation of a sample/population, I will use index \\(t\\) to refer to a specific observation (Ex. \\(Y_t\\)), no matter if it is cross-sectional or time series data. This choice is consistent with Amemiya’s notation.\nFor number of parameters in a model, I will use \\(p\\) (ex. \\(X_p\\)), which is the standard in statistics. However, econometricians will often use \\(k\\) to refer to the number of parameters.",

    "text": "1.1 Data Generating Process\nLet us say we have two random variables in our population, \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\). For example, perhaps \\(Y\\) is income, and \\(X\\) is education. These two are random variables, since if we select a random person from the population, we have a certain probability of getting someone with 10 years of education, and a certain probability of getting someone with 11 years of education, and so on.\nWe want to explain how \\(Y\\) changes when \\(X\\) changes. How does income change, when we increase education? One way we could do this is to imagine a data-generating process (DGP). A DGP is how (we imagine/model) data is generated in the real world. We can write a DGP as\n\\[\nY_i = f(X_i, \\eps_i)\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\nWhere \\(f\\) is some function that takes an individual \\(i\\)’s \\(X\\) value and outputs a \\(Y\\) value. \\(f\\) is a function that takes an individuals education level, and determines their income.\nYou might notice the \\(\\eps_i\\). What is that? Well, we know that education \\(X\\) is not the only thing that affects income \\(Y\\). Other factors, such as an individual’s GPA, their parent’s wealth, their field of study, their occupation, all affect income \\(Y\\). Even when we consider all possible causes income, there is still likely some randomness in an individual’s income due to luck. \\(\\eps_i\\) is the stochastic-error term, and is essentially capturing everything else that is not education \\(X\\) (so other factors + luck), and how everything not education \\(X\\) is affecting income \\(Y\\).\nFunction \\(f\\) in our data-generating process from Equation 1.1 can be any function. It could be a quadratic, an exponential curve, anything, depending on our theoretical beliefs of how education impacts income. We typically assume \\(f\\) is some linear function in the form of \\(y = mx + b\\), as you have learned in algebra lessons. We will see why this linear formulation is so powerful throughout this course. Assuming a linear data generating process, our DGP of \\(Y_i = f(X_i, \\eps_i)\\) can be written as\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i + \\eps_i\n\\]\nAn advantage of this linear DGP is that it is easily interpretable. \\(\\beta_1\\) is the slope, and is a way we can describe the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). If \\(\\beta_1\\) is positive, then as \\(X\\) increases, \\(Y\\) also increases. If \\(\\beta_1\\) is negative, then as \\(X\\) increases, \\(Y\\) decreases. If \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\), then there is no relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). If \\(\\beta_1\\) is further away from 0 (both negative or positive), the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is larger in magnitude.\nLike we mentioned before, education is not the only thing that affects income. Of course, we cannot possibly capture every possible cause of \\(Y\\), especially when we have unobservable/un-measurable variables, such as luck. However, including as many of these causes will increase the accuracy of our model of the data generating process.\nThus, instead of just one \\(X\\), we can instead think of a data generating process with \\(p\\) number of \\(X\\) variables, called \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p\\). Our new data generating process is\n\\[\nY_i = f(X_{i1}, X_{i2}, \\dots, X_{ip}, \\eps_i)\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\n\\(\\eps_i\\) in this case covers everything not \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_P\\) that also affects \\(Y\\).",

    "text": "1.2 The Linear Model\nThe multiple linear regression is the model for the DGP expressed in Equation 1.2:\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{i1} + \\beta_2X_{i2} + \\dots + \\beta_pX_{ip} + \\eps_i\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\n\\(Y\\) is the outcome variable, since it is the outcome of our data generating process. We also call this the dependent variable. \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) are the explanatory variables. They are also often referred to as independent variables or regressors. \\(\\eps_i\\) is the error term.\nSimilar to before, \\(\\beta_0\\) is the y-intercept, and \\(\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) are the slopes corresponding to the \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) they are multiplied to. Importantly, we do not know the values of \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\), since these are population parameters. We will introduce methods to estimate these parameters from our sample in the next chapter.\nSo far, we have focused on outcome \\(Y_i\\), the \\(Y\\) value of some specific observation \\(i\\). However, sometimes we do not want to focus on one specific observation \\(i\\). Instead, we can define our data generating process in respect to the conditional expectation function \\(\\E(Y_i|X_i)\\):\n\\[\n\\E(Y_i|X_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_{i1} + \\beta_2X_{i2} + \\dots + \\beta_pX_{ip}\n\\tag{1.4}\\]\nNotice that the stochastic error term \\(\\eps_i\\) has dissapeared. Why? Well since we are looking at the average/expected \\(Y_i\\), not a specific \\(Y_i\\), we make the assumption that on average, our errors \\(\\eps_i\\) are 0. This makes sense - if our average errors \\(\\eps_i\\) were not 0 (let us say 1), we could just change the value of \\(\\beta_0\\) to make sure \\(\\E \\eps_i = 0\\).\nThe model as defined in Equation 1.3 is a great way to visualise all of the elements of our linear model. However, we often want to shorten this equation so that it is easier to write and manipulate mathematically. One way to do this is to simplify with summation notation:\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^p\\beta_jX_{ij} + \\eps_i\n\\tag{1.5}\\]\nThis model is where we get the terminology of \\(\\beta_j\\) and \\(X_j\\), which I will use frequently to refer to any one of the parameters/explanatory variables. When I mention \\(\\beta_j\\) or \\(X_j\\), that means what I am saying applies to any of \\(\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) or \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\).\nHowever, even the summation form is not simplified enough. We often want to represent the model in terms of vectors. Let us define two vectors \\(\\b x_i\\), the vector of \\(X_1, \\dots X_p\\) values for individual \\(i\\), and \\(\\b \\beta\\), the vector of coefficients \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\):\n\\[\n\\b x_i = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ X_{i1} \\\\ X_{i2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ X_{ip}\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad \\b \\beta = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\ \\beta_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_p\\end{pmatrix}\n\\tag{1.6}\\]\nUsing these two matrices, we can rewrite our linear model to\n\\[\nY_i = \\b x_i^\\top \\b \\beta + \\eps_i\n\\tag{1.7}\\]\nwhere \\(\\b x_i^\\top\\) is the transpose of vector \\(\\b x_i\\). Notice that \\(\\b x_i\\) has a 1 in its first element. This is because this 1 is multiplied to the \\(\\beta_0\\) in the model.\nNotice how all of our regression equations have subscript \\(i\\). That means \\(Y_i\\) is the \\(Y\\) value of individual \\(i\\) in the population. Well, this implies that for every individual \\(i = 1, 2, \\dots, n\\), they have their own regression equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{matrix}\nY_1 = \\b x_1^\\top\\b\\beta + \\eps_1 \\\\\nY_2 = \\b x_2^\\top\\b\\beta + \\eps_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\qquad \\qquad \\vdots \\\\\nY_n = \\b x_1^\\top\\b\\beta + \\eps_n\n\\end{matrix}\n\\]\nWe can imagine this in terms of vectors and matrices. Imagine a vector \\(\\b y\\), which contains \\((Y_1, Y_2, \\dots, Y_n)\\). Our model could be written as:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} Y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\b x_1^\\top \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\b x_n^\\top\n\\end{pmatrix} \\b \\beta +\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\eps_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\eps_n \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nAnd we remember from Equation 1.6, that \\(\\b x_i^\\top\\) and \\(\\b \\beta\\) are vectors so we can expand this matrix to:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} Y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & X_{11} & \\dots & X_{1p} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1 & X_{n1} & \\dots & X_{np}\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\\beta_0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_p \\end{pmatrix} +\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\eps_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\eps_n \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nWhich we almost always notate as\n\\[\n\\b y = \\b{X\\beta} + \\b \\eps\n\\]\nThat is the linear algebra form of the linear model that we will use the most. Vector \\(\\b\\beta\\) contains all of the population parameters, that will will discuss how to estimate in the next chapter.",

Also note that for the interpretations of \\(\\beta_j\\), I mentioned “holding other explanatory variables constant”. This means \\(\\beta_j\\) is measuring the effect of \\(X_j\\) on \\(Y\\), assuming all other explanatory variables \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) that are not \\(X_j\\) do not change. We will prove why \\(\\beta_j\\) can be interpreted in this way in the next chapter.\n\\(\\beta_j\\) measures the unit change in \\(Y\\) given a unit change in \\(X\\). However sometimes, unit change is not very useful - as it depends on how the variable is measured. For example, what does a 5 unit change in democracy mean? Is that big, small? It is hard to tell.\nInstead, we can look at the change in standard deviations. How much does \\(Y\\) change in terms of the standard deviation of \\(Y\\) (\\(\\sigma_Y\\)), given a one-standard deviation \\(\\sigma_X\\) increase in \\(X\\)?\nFor simplicity, let us use a simple linear regression \\(\\E(Y_i|X_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i\\). We want to find the difference in expected \\(Y_i\\) when \\(X_i = x + \\sigma_X\\) and when \\(X_i = x\\):\n\\[\n\\E \\left(\\frac{Y_i}{\\sigma_Y} | X_i = x + \\sigma_X \\right ) - \\E \\left(\\frac{Y_i}{\\sigma_Y} | X_i = x \\right )\n\\]\nWe know that expectations are linear, so we can write\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& = \\frac{\\E(Y_i|X_i = x+ \\sigma_X)}{\\sigma_Y} - \\frac{\\E(Y_i|X_i = x)}{\\sigma_Y} \\\\\n& = \\frac{\\E(Y_i|X_i = x+ \\sigma_X) - \\E(Y_i|X_i = x)}{\\sigma_Y}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we know from Equation 1.5 what the conditional expectation \\(\\E(Y_i|X_i)\\) looks like. Let us plug in \\(X_i = x + \\sigma_X\\) and \\(X_i = x\\) to get\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1(x+\\sigma_X) - [\\beta_0 + \\beta_1(x)]}{\\sigma_Y}\n\\]\nAnd now, we can multiply out and then simplify to get\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\beta_1\\sigma_X - \\beta_0  - \\beta_1x}{\\sigma_y} \\ = \\ \\frac{\\beta_1\\sigma_X}{\\sigma_Y}\n\\]\nThus, we can see that as we increase \\(X\\) by 1 standard deviation \\(\\sigma_X\\), the \\(Y\\) changes by \\(\\beta_1 \\sigma_X/\\sigma_Y\\) standard deviations.\nFinally, note that these are the interpretations of the population parameters \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\), for which we do not know the values of. We must estimate these values, which we will explore in the next chapter.",

    "section": "1.4 The Classical Assumptions",
    "text": "1.4 The Classical Assumptions\nThe linear model we have introduced has several classical assumptions that are normally assumed to be met. For this chapter, it is sufficient to know these assumptions. In future chapters, we will explore why each assumption is critical in establishing the properties of the linear model.\n\nAssumption 1: Linearity in Parameters\nOur linear regression should be linear in parameters. In other words, it can be written in the linear algebra form \\(\\b y = \\b{X\\beta} + \\b\\eps\\). This means that no two parameters \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) can be multiplied/divided together in the model, only added or subtracted, as we see for example in Equation 1.3.\nNote that I say linear in parameters, not linear in explanatory variables. For example, take this linear model:\n\\[\nY_i= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i + \\beta_2X_i^2\n\\]\nThis model is still linear! If you pretend \\(X_i\\) and \\(X_i^2\\) are two different variables, you can still write it in the form \\(\\b y = \\b{X\\beta} + \\b\\eps\\). This is also the case when we have multiplied explanatory variables. The only requirement is that parameters \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) are not multiplied together.\n\n\nAssumption 2: Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.)\nOur observations in our population are independent and identically distributed. This essentially means that for any two observations \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), their \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) values are drawn from the same distribution with the same probabilities. Seeing unit \\(i\\)’s \\(Y_i\\) value has no impact on the probability of unit \\(j\\) drawing any \\(Y_j\\) value.\nThis assumption is also frequently called random sampling, since randomly sampling from a population almost always ensures this requirement is met.\n\n\nAssumption 3: No Perfect Multicolinearity\nNone of our explanatory variables have perfect multicollinearity. This implies two things:\n\nNo explanatory variable is perfectly correlated with any other explanatory variable. For example, if you have two variables height in inches and height in feet, you will get two perfectly correlated variables. We cannot have this.\nNo explanatory variable can be written as a linear function of any combiniation of other explanatory variables. This is usually an issue we will deal with in specifying binary and categorical \\(X\\), as we will discuss later in the chapter.\n\nThe reason for this assumption is that for the derivation of parameter estimates, we need to ensure the matrix \\(\\b X^\\top \\b X\\) is invertable. This is violated when matrix \\(\\b X\\) is not full rank, which means our columns are not linearly independent, which is a result of violating either of the two specifications listed.\n\n\nAssumption 4: Zero Conditional Mean\nZero conditional mean is quite a technical condition, but arguably the most important. Mathematically, it is stated as:\n\\[\n\\E(\\b\\eps|\\b X) = 0\n\\]\nThis can be broken down into two smaller conditions:\n\n\\(\\E(\\b\\eps) = 0\\), also called zero-mean. This part of the assumption is almost never violated, because in theory, if \\(\\E\\eps ≠ 0\\), you could just adjust the value of \\(\\beta_0\\) higher or lower to meet the condition.\nThe second part of the assumption is \\(cov(\\e | \\X) = 0\\), called strict exogeneity. This essentially means that no explanatory variable \\(X_1, \\dots, X_P\\) should be correlated with the error term \\(\\eps_i\\), and no function/combination of \\(X_1, \\dots, X_P\\) should be correlated with \\(\\eps_i\\).\n\nThis is arguably the most important condition in the classical linear model, as if it is violated, it makes our parameter estimates \\(\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) unreliable (as we will see in the next chapter). In fact, much of the field of causal inference is based on trying to ensure strict exogeneity is met.\n\n\nAssumption 5: Spherical Errors",

    "text": "Data Generating Process\nLet us say we have two random variables in our population, \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\). For example, perhaps \\(Y\\) is income, and \\(X\\) is education. These two are random variables, since if we select a random person from the population, we have a certain probability of getting someone with 10 years of education, and a certain probability of getting someone with 11 years of education, and so on.\nWe want to explain how \\(Y\\) changes when \\(X\\) changes. How does income change, when we increase education? One way we could do this is to imagine a data-generating process (DGP). A DGP is how (we imagine/model) data is generated in the real world. We can write a DGP as\n\\[\nY_i = f(X_i, \\eps_i)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nWhere \\(f\\) is some function that takes an individual \\(i\\)’s \\(X\\) value and outputs a \\(Y\\) value. \\(f\\) is a function that takes an individuals education level, and determines their income.\nYou might notice the \\(\\eps_i\\). What is that? Well, we know that education \\(X\\) is not the only thing that affects income \\(Y\\). Other factors, such as an individual’s GPA, their parent’s wealth, their field of study, their occupation, all affect income \\(Y\\). Even when we consider all possible causes income, there is still likely some randomness in an individual’s income due to luck. \\(\\eps_i\\) is the stochastic-error term, and is essentially capturing everything else that is not education \\(X\\) (so other factors + luck), and how everything not education \\(X\\) is affecting income \\(Y\\).\nFunction \\(f\\) in our data-generating process from Equation eq-dgp can be any function. It could be a quadratic, an exponential curve, anything, depending on our theoretical beliefs of how education impacts income. We typically assume \\(f\\) is some linear function in the form of \\(y = mx + b\\), as you have learned in algebra lessons. We will see why this linear formulation is so powerful throughout this course. Assuming a linear data generating process, our DGP of \\(Y_i = f(X_i, \\eps_i)\\) can be written as\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i + \\eps_i\n\\]\nAn advantage of this linear DGP is that it is easily interpretable. \\(\\beta_1\\) is the slope, and is a way we can describe the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). If \\(\\beta_1\\) is positive, then as \\(X\\) increases, \\(Y\\) also increases. If \\(\\beta_1\\) is negative, then as \\(X\\) increases, \\(Y\\) decreases. If \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\), then there is no relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). If \\(\\beta_1\\) is further away from 0 (both negative or positive), the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is larger in magnitude.\nLike we mentioned before, education is not the only thing that affects income. Of course, we cannot possibly capture every possible cause of \\(Y\\), especially when we have unobservable/un-measurable variables, such as luck. However, including as many of these causes will increase the accuracy of our model of the data generating process.\nThus, instead of just one \\(X\\), we can instead think of a data generating process with \\(p\\) number of \\(X\\) variables, called \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p\\). Our new data generating process is\n\\[\nY_i = f(X_{i1}, X_{i2}, \\dots, X_{ip}, \\eps_i)\n\\tag{2}\\]\n\\(\\eps_i\\) in this case covers everything not \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_P\\) that also affects \\(Y\\)."

We also call this the dependent variable. \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) are the explanatory variables. They are also often referred to as independent variables or regressors. \\(\\eps_i\\) is the error term.\nSimilar to before, \\(\\beta_0\\) is the y-intercept, and \\(\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) are the slopes corresponding to the \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) they are multiplied to. Importantly, we do not know the values of \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\), since these are population parameters. We will introduce methods to estimate these parameters from our sample in the next chapter.\nSo far, we have focused on outcome \\(Y_i\\), the \\(Y\\) value of some specific observation \\(i\\). However, sometimes we do not want to focus on one specific observation \\(i\\). Instead, we can define our data generating process in respect to the conditional expectation function \\(\\E(Y_i|X_i)\\):\n\\[\n\\E(Y_i|X_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_{i1} + \\beta_2X_{i2} + \\dots + \\beta_pX_{ip}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nNotice that the stochastic error term \\(\\eps_i\\) has dissapeared. Why? Well since we are looking at the average/expected \\(Y_i\\), not a specific \\(Y_i\\), we make the assumption that on average, our errors \\(\\eps_i\\) are 0. This makes sense - if our average errors \\(\\eps_i\\) were not 0 (let us say 1), we could just change the value of \\(\\beta_0\\) to make sure \\(\\E \\eps_i = 0\\).\nThe model as defined in Equation eq-lin1 is a great way to visualise all of the elements of our linear model. However, we often want to shorten this equation so that it is easier to write and manipulate mathematically. One way to do this is to simplify with summation notation:\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^p\\beta_jX_{ij} + \\eps_i\n\\tag{5}\\]\nThis model is where we get the terminology of \\(\\beta_j\\) and \\(X_j\\), which I will use frequently to refer to any one of the parameters/explanatory variables. When I mention \\(\\beta_j\\) or \\(X_j\\), that means what I am saying applies to any of \\(\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) or \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\).\nHowever, even the summation form is not simplified enough. We often want to represent the model in terms of vectors. Let us define two vectors \\(\\b x_i\\), the vector of \\(X_1, \\dots X_p\\) values for individual \\(i\\), and \\(\\b \\beta\\), the vector of coefficients \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\):\n\\[\n\\b x_i = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ X_{i1} \\\\ X_{i2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ X_{ip}\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad \\b \\beta = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\ \\beta_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_p\\end{pmatrix}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nUsing these two matrices, we can rewrite our linear model to\n\\[\nY_i = \\b x_i^\\top \\b \\beta + \\eps_i\n\\tag{7}\\]\nwhere \\(\\b x_i^\\top\\) is the transpose of vector \\(\\b x_i\\). Notice that \\(\\b x_i\\) has a 1 in its first element. This is because this 1 is multiplied to the \\(\\beta_0\\) in the model.\nNotice how all of our regression equations have subscript \\(i\\). That means \\(Y_i\\) is the \\(Y\\) value of individual \\(i\\) in the population. Well, this implies that for every individual \\(i = 1, 2, \\dots, n\\), they have their own regression equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{matrix}\nY_1 = \\b x_1^\\top\\b\\beta + \\eps_1 \\\\\nY_2 = \\b x_2^\\top\\b\\beta + \\eps_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\qquad \\qquad \\vdots \\\\\nY_n = \\b x_1^\\top\\b\\beta + \\eps_n\n\\end{matrix}\n\\]\nWe can imagine this in terms of vectors and matrices. Imagine a vector \\(\\b y\\), which contains \\((Y_1, Y_2, \\dots, Y_n)\\). Our model could be written as:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} Y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\b x_1^\\top \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\b x_n^\\top\n\\end{pmatrix} \\b \\beta +\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\eps_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\eps_n \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nAnd we remember from Equation eq-vec, that \\(\\b x_i^\\top\\) and \\(\\b \\beta\\) are vectors so we can expand this matrix to:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} Y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & X_{11} & \\dots & X_{1p} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1 & X_{n1} & \\dots & X_{np}\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\\beta_0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_p \\end{pmatrix} +\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\eps_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\eps_n \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nWhich we almost always notate as\n\\[\n\\b y = \\b{X\\beta} + \\b \\eps\n\\]\nThat is the linear algebra form of the linear model that we will use the most. Vector \\(\\b\\beta\\) contains all of the population parameters, that will will discuss how to estimate in the next chapter."

This means that no two parameters \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) can be multiplied/divided together in the model, only added or subtracted, as we see for example in Equation eq-lin1.\nNote that I say linear in parameters, not linear in explanatory variables. For example, take this linear model:\n\\[\nY_i= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i + \\beta_2X_i^2\n\\]\nThis model is still linear! If you pretend \\(X_i\\) and \\(X_i^2\\) are two different variables, you can still write it in the form \\(\\b y = \\b{X\\beta} + \\b\\eps\\). This is also the case when we have multiplied explanatory variables. The only requirement is that parameters \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) are not multiplied together.\n\n\nAssumption 2: Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.)\nOur observations in our population are independent and identically distributed. This essentially means that for any two observations \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), their \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) values are drawn from the same distribution with the same probabilities. Seeing unit \\(i\\)’s \\(Y_i\\) value has no impact on the probability of unit \\(j\\) drawing any \\(Y_j\\) value.\nThis assumption is also frequently called random sampling, since randomly sampling from a population almost always ensures this requirement is met.\n\n\nAssumption 3: No Perfect Multicolinearity\nNone of our explanatory variables have perfect multicollinearity. This implies two things:\n\nNo explanatory variable is perfectly correlated with any other explanatory variable. For example, if you have two variables height in inches and height in feet, you will get two perfectly correlated variables. We cannot have this.\nNo explanatory variable can be written as a linear function of any combiniation of other explanatory variables. This is usually an issue we will deal with in specifying binary and categorical \\(X\\), as we will discuss later in the chapter.\n\nThe reason for this assumption is that for the derivation of parameter estimates, we need to ensure the matrix \\(\\b X^\\top \\b X\\) is invertable. This is violated when matrix \\(\\b X\\) is not full rank, which means our columns are not linearly independent, which is a result of violating either of the two specifications listed.\n\n\nAssumption 4: Zero Conditional Mean\nZero conditional mean is quite a technical condition, but arguably the most important. Mathematically, it is stated as:\n\\[\n\\E(\\b\\eps|\\b X) = 0\n\\]\nThis can be broken down into two smaller conditions:\n\n\\(\\E(\\b\\eps) = 0\\), also called zero-mean. This part of the assumption is almost never violated, because in theory, if \\(\\E\\eps ≠ 0\\), you could just adjust the value of \\(\\beta_0\\) higher or lower to meet the condition.\nThe second part of the assumption is \\(cov(\\e | \\X) = 0\\), called strict exogeneity. This essentially means that no explanatory variable \\(X_1, \\dots, X_P\\) should be correlated with the error term \\(\\eps_i\\), and no function/combination of \\(X_1, \\dots, X_P\\) should be correlated with \\(\\eps_i\\).\n\nThis is arguably the most important condition in the classical linear model, as if it is violated, it makes our parameter estimates \\(\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) unreliable (as we will see in the next chapter). In fact, much of the field of causal inference is based on trying to ensure strict exogeneity is met.\n\n\nAssumption 5: Spherical Errors"

    "text": "2.1 Data Generating Process\nLet us say we are interested in studying some variable \\(Y\\) in the population. To study \\(Y\\), we can imagine how \\(Y\\) was “generated” in the population through a model of the data generating process - how we believe the real values of \\(Y\\) in the population came to be.\nFor example, let us say we are interested in the variable height \\(Y\\) in the population (let us say in the UK). Let us (boldly, and for simplification) assume any individual \\(t\\)’s height is completely random and selected from a normal distribution. Then we can model the data generating process for any individual’s \\(Y_t\\) value as\n\\[\nY_t \\sim \\mathcal N(\\mu_Y, \\ \\sigma^2_Y)\n\\]\nThe parameters of this model are \\(\\b\\theta = (\\mu_Y, \\sigma^2_Y)\\), that determine the value of \\(Y_t\\). If we can find the values of \\(\\b\\theta\\), then we can explain how variable height \\(Y\\) works in the population.\nObviously, most variables \\(Y\\) in the real world are not completely random. For example, if \\(Y\\) is income, we might assume that another variable education \\(X\\) is associated with income \\(Y\\). In this scenario, we can model the data generating process as\n\\[\nY_t \\sim \\mathcal N( X\\beta, \\sigma^2_Y)\n\\]\nWhere \\(X\\beta\\) is now the expectation of the normal distribution. In this model, our parameters \\(\\theta\\) are now \\(\\b\\theta = (\\beta, \\sigma^2_Y)\\). This model states that as education \\(X\\) increases by 1, the expected \\(Y\\) value changes by \\(\\beta\\). This parameter \\(\\beta\\), if we can estimate it, will tell us the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\nThis model still incorporates randomness through the random normal distribution with variance \\(\\sigma^2_Y\\) -this represents that not everyone with the same education will make the same exact income.\nWe can make our data generating process more complex. Perhaps, we believe that multiple variables \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p\\) are correlated with \\(Y\\). We can model this as\n\\[\nY_t \\sim \\mathcal N(\\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_pX_p, \\ \\sigma^2_Y)\n\\]\nWhere now the parameters are \\(\\b\\theta = (\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_p, \\sigma^2_Y)\\), and finding the values of these parameters will help us understand \\(Y\\) and its relationship with \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\).\nA lot of natural phenomena are normally distributed. However, we are not limited to the normal distribution: any distribution is possible. We can also change the functional form of the relationships (maybe instead of \\(\\beta X\\), the mean is described by \\(\\beta X^2\\)).\nWe choose the way we model our DGP based on what we know about \\(Y\\) from our own intuition and prior research. Once we have a model of the DGP, we will know that the value of \\(Y_i\\) depends on some parameters \\(\\b\\theta\\), for which we do not know the value of. The next step of statistics will be trying to figure out the values of \\(\\b\\theta\\).",

    "section": "2.2 The Linear Model",
    "text": "2.2 The Linear Model\nThe multiple linear regression is the model for the DGP expressed in Equation 2.2:\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{i1} + \\beta_2X_{i2} + \\dots + \\beta_pX_{ip} + \\eps_i\n\\tag{2.3}\\]\n\\(Y\\) is the outcome variable, since it is the outcome of our data generating process. We also call this the dependent variable. \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) are the explanatory variables. They are also often referred to as independent variables or regressors. \\(\\eps_i\\) is the error term.\nSimilar to before, \\(\\beta_0\\) is the y-intercept, and \\(\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) are the slopes corresponding to the \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) they are multiplied to. Importantly, we do not know the values of \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\), since these are population parameters. We will introduce methods to estimate these parameters from our sample in the next chapter.\nSo far, we have focused on outcome \\(Y_i\\), the \\(Y\\) value of some specific observation \\(i\\). However, sometimes we do not want to focus on one specific observation \\(i\\). Instead, we can define our data generating process in respect to the conditional expectation function \\(\\E(Y_i|X_i)\\):\n\\[\n\\E(Y_i|X_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_{i1} + \\beta_2X_{i2} + \\dots + \\beta_pX_{ip}\n\\tag{2.4}\\]\nNotice that the stochastic error term \\(\\eps_i\\) has dissapeared. Why? Well since we are looking at the average/expected \\(Y_i\\), not a specific \\(Y_i\\), we make the assumption that on average, our errors \\(\\eps_i\\) are 0. This makes sense - if our average errors \\(\\eps_i\\) were not 0 (let us say 1), we could just change the value of \\(\\beta_0\\) to make sure \\(\\E \\eps_i = 0\\).\nThe model as defined in Equation 2.3 is a great way to visualise all of the elements of our linear model. However, we often want to shorten this equation so that it is easier to write and manipulate mathematically. One way to do this is to simplify with summation notation:\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^p\\beta_jX_{ij} + \\eps_i\n\\tag{2.5}\\]\nThis model is where we get the terminology of \\(\\beta_j\\) and \\(X_j\\), which I will use frequently to refer to any one of the parameters/explanatory variables. When I mention \\(\\beta_j\\) or \\(X_j\\), that means what I am saying applies to any of \\(\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) or \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\).\nHowever, even the summation form is not simplified enough. We often want to represent the model in terms of vectors. Let us define two vectors \\(\\b x_i\\), the vector of \\(X_1, \\dots X_p\\) values for individual \\(i\\), and \\(\\b \\beta\\), the vector of coefficients \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\):\n\\[\n\\b x_i = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ X_{i1} \\\\ X_{i2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ X_{ip}\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad \\b \\beta = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\ \\beta_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_p\\end{pmatrix}\n\\tag{2.6}\\]\nUsing these two matrices, we can rewrite our linear model to\n\\[\nY_i = \\b x_i^\\top \\b \\beta + \\eps_i\n\\tag{2.7}\\]\nwhere \\(\\b x_i^\\top\\) is the transpose of vector \\(\\b x_i\\). Notice that \\(\\b x_i\\) has a 1 in its first element. This is because this 1 is multiplied to the \\(\\beta_0\\) in the model.\nNotice how all of our regression equations have subscript \\(i\\). That means \\(Y_i\\) is the \\(Y\\) value of individual \\(i\\) in the population. Well, this implies that for every individual \\(i = 1, 2, \\dots, n\\), they have their own regression equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{matrix}\nY_1 = \\b x_1^\\top\\b\\beta + \\eps_1 \\\\\nY_2 = \\b x_2^\\top\\b\\beta + \\eps_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\qquad \\qquad \\vdots \\\\\nY_n = \\b x_1^\\top\\b\\beta + \\eps_n\n\\end{matrix}\n\\]\nWe can imagine this in terms of vectors and matrices. Imagine a vector \\(\\b y\\), which contains \\((Y_1, Y_2, \\dots, Y_n)\\). Our model could be written as:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} Y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\b x_1^\\top \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\b x_n^\\top\n\\end{pmatrix} \\b \\beta +\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\eps_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\eps_n \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nAnd we remember from Equation 2.6, that \\(\\b x_i^\\top\\) and \\(\\b \\beta\\) are vectors so we can expand this matrix to:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} Y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & X_{11} & \\dots & X_{1p} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1 & X_{n1} & \\dots & X_{np}\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\\beta_0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_p \\end{pmatrix} +\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\eps_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\eps_n \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nWhich we almost always notate as\n\\[\n\\b y = \\b{X\\beta} + \\b \\eps\n\\]\nThat is the linear algebra form of the linear model that we will use the most. Vector \\(\\b\\beta\\) contains all of the population parameters, that will will discuss how to estimate in the next chapter.",

    "text": "2.3 Parameters of the Model\nWe have established that our linear model has population parameters \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) that need to be estimated. But, what do these population parameters \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) actually refer to? What do they mean? We know that \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept term, and \\(\\beta_j\\) (any one of \\(\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\)) is the slope term. Using these ideas, we can come up with the following interpretations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous \\(X_{j}\\)\nBinary \\(X_{j}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\beta_j\\)\nFor every one unit increase in \\(X_{j}\\), there is an expected \\(\\beta_j\\) unit change in \\(Y\\), holding all other explanatory variables constant.\nThere is a \\(\\beta_j\\) unit difference in \\(Y\\) between category \\(X_{j} = 1\\) and category \\(X_{j} = 0\\), holding all other explanatory variables constant.\n\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\)\nWhen all explanatory variables equal 0, the expected value of \\(Y\\) is \\(\\beta_0\\).\nFor category \\(X_{j} = 0\\), the expected value of \\(Y\\) is \\(\\beta_0\\) (when all other explanatory variables equal 0).\n\n\n\n\nThese interpretations are not causal effects, just correlations. Also note that for the interpretations of \\(\\beta_j\\), I mentioned “holding other explanatory variables constant”. This means \\(\\beta_j\\) is measuring the effect of \\(X_j\\) on \\(Y\\), assuming all other explanatory variables \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) that are not \\(X_j\\) do not change. We will prove why \\(\\beta_j\\) can be interpreted in this way in the next chapter.\n\\(\\beta_j\\) measures the unit change in \\(Y\\) given a unit change in \\(X\\). However sometimes, unit change is not very useful - as it depends on how the variable is measured. For example, what does a 5 unit change in democracy mean? Is that big, small? It is hard to tell.\nInstead, we can look at the change in standard deviations. How much does \\(Y\\) change in terms of the standard deviation of \\(Y\\) (\\(\\sigma_Y\\)), given a one-standard deviation \\(\\sigma_X\\) increase in \\(X\\)?\nFor simplicity, let us use a simple linear regression \\(\\E(Y_i|X_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i\\). We want to find the difference in expected \\(Y_i\\) when \\(X_i = x + \\sigma_X\\) and when \\(X_i = x\\):\n\\[\n\\E \\left(\\frac{Y_i}{\\sigma_Y} | X_i = x + \\sigma_X \\right ) - \\E \\left(\\frac{Y_i}{\\sigma_Y} | X_i = x \\right )\n\\]\nWe know that expectations are linear, so we can write\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& = \\frac{\\E(Y_i|X_i = x+ \\sigma_X)}{\\sigma_Y} - \\frac{\\E(Y_i|X_i = x)}{\\sigma_Y} \\\\\n& = \\frac{\\E(Y_i|X_i = x+ \\sigma_X) - \\E(Y_i|X_i = x)}{\\sigma_Y}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, we know from Equation 2.4 what the conditional expectation \\(\\E(Y_i|X_i)\\) looks like. Let us plug in \\(X_i = x + \\sigma_X\\) and \\(X_i = x\\) to get\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1(x+\\sigma_X) - [\\beta_0 + \\beta_1(x)]}{\\sigma_Y}\n\\]\nAnd now, we can multiply out and then simplify to get\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\beta_1\\sigma_X - \\beta_0  - \\beta_1x}{\\sigma_y} \\ = \\ \\frac{\\beta_1\\sigma_X}{\\sigma_Y}\n\\]\nThus, we can see that as we increase \\(X\\) by 1 standard deviation \\(\\sigma_X\\), the \\(Y\\) changes by \\(\\beta_1 \\sigma_X/\\sigma_Y\\) standard deviations.\nFinally, note that these are the interpretations of the population parameters \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\), for which we do not know the values of. We must estimate these values, which we will explore in the next chapter.",

Only one outcome \\(\\omega\\) can be realised from this random variable at a time.\nDiscrete random variables have a set of finite, distinct potential outcomes \\(\\Omega\\).

We can express the probability of a certain outcome \\(\\omega\\) with a probability density function (pdf).\nFor discrete variables, we just plug in the outcome \\(y\\) we want the probability of.

    "text": "1.2 Expectation and Variance\nWe can summarise most variables by two metrics: their expectation and variance.\nThe expectation of a random variable \\(Y\\), notated \\(\\E Y\\) or \\(\\mu_Y\\), also called expected value or mane, is a measure for the centre or average of a random value. As the name implies, if we randomly draw an outcome \\(y\\) from a random variable \\(Y\\), the average outcome that we get will be \\(\\E Y\\).\n\nDefinition 1.2 (Expectation) For discrete random variables, the expectation is defined as the sum of every possible outcome \\(y_i\\) multiplied with their probability of occuring \\(f_Y(y_i)\\) (as given by the PDF):\n\\[\n\\E Y = \\mu_Y =  \\sum\\limits_i y_if_Y(y_i)\n\\]\nFor continuous random variables, the expectation is given by\n\\[\n\\E Y = \\int\\limits_{-∞}^∞y f_Y(y)dy\n\\]\n\n\nExpected values also can be manipulated algebraiacally, as they are considered linear.\n\nTheorem 1.1 (Linearity of Expectations) Expectations are linear. This means that they can be added:\n\\[\n\\E (X+Y) = \\E X + \\E Y\n\\]\nAnd they can be multiplied with constants:\n\\[\n\\E(aX) = a  \\E X\n\\]\n\n\nWhile expectation measures the average/centre of a random variable, we might also want to know something about how spread out the outcomes of a random variable are. This is what variance does.\n\nDefinition 1.3 (Variance) Variance is a measure of the spread of a random variable \\(Y\\), notated \\(\\V Y\\) or \\(\\sigma^2_Y\\). Mathematically speaking, it is the expected distance between each value of \\(Y\\) and \\(\\E Y\\) squared:\n\\[\n\\V Y = \\sigma^2_Y = \\E [(Y - \\E Y)^2]\n\\]\n\n\nHigher variance indicates a more spread out distribution, and lower variance indicates a less spread out distribution. The two parameters of expectation and variance can be used to define and summarise almost any distribution in statistics. Variance also has a useful algebraic property.\n\nTheorem 1.2 (Algebraic Property of Variance) If \\(c\\) and \\(b\\) are constants, and \\(X\\) is a random variable, the following is true:\n\\[\n\\V(c + bX) = b^2 \\V(X)\n\\]\nWe can generalise this to linear algebra. If \\(\\b u\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional vector of random variables, and \\(\\b c\\) is a \\(m\\)-dimensional vector, and \\(\\b B\\) is an \\(m \\times n\\) matrix with fixed constants, then:\n\\[\n\\V(\\b c+ \\b{Bu}) = \\b B \\V(\\b u) \\b B^\\top\n\\]",

We take 1 sample, and calculate our estimate \\(\\hat\\theta_1\\). We take a second sample, and calculate our estimate \\(\\hat\\theta_2\\), which is slightly different than the first. We then keep taking more and more samples (close to infinity number of samples), until we have estimates \\(\\hat\\theta_1, \\hat\\theta_2, \\hat\\theta_3, \\dots, \\hat\\theta_N\\).\nNow, we can plot our different sample estimates \\(\\hat\\theta_1, \\dots, \\hat\\theta_n\\) on a distribution.

One property relating to the expectation of our estimator/sampling distribution is unbiasedness.\n\nDefinition 2.4 (Unbiased Estimator) An estimator is considered unbiased, if its estimates \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) have an expectation that is equal to the value of the true population parameter.\n\\[\n\\E \\hat\\theta_n = \\theta\n\\]\n\n\nOr in other words, if we repeatedly sample and use an unbiased estimator to calculate our estimates \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\), on average, the estimates will be equal to the true population value \\(\\theta\\) of interest. In terms of the sampling distirbution, this means that the expectation (centre) of the sampling distribution is equal to the true population value \\(\\theta\\).\nWe want an unbiased estimator, because if \\(\\E\\hat\\theta_n = \\theta\\), then we know that our “expected” value of our estimator, our best guess of the estimator’s value, is indeed, the correct true population parameter \\(\\theta\\).\nHowever, just like with random variables, we do not just care about the expected value of the estimator. We also care about its variance - how spread out/precise the individual estimates \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) of an estimator are.\nFor example, let us say we have some true population parameter \\(\\theta = 0\\), and two estimators \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). \\(A\\) produces sample estimates -1 and 1, while \\(B\\) produces sample estimates -100 and 100.\nBoth estimators are unbiased, but, clearly, estimator \\(A\\)’s individual sample estimates are on average, much closer to the true \\(\\theta = 0\\). Thus, we care about the variance of the estimator.\n\nDefinition 2.5 (Variance of an Estimator) The variance of an estimator, which is also the variance of the sampling distribution, can be quantified as\n\\[\n\\V \\hat\\theta_n = \\E[(\\hat\\theta_n - \\E \\hat\\theta_n)^2]\n\\]\n\n\nIn an ideal world, we want an estimator that has the least variance of any unbiased estimator. This way, we know the estimator is on average correct, and that each individual estimate \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) the estimator produces is not very far from the true population value of \\(\\theta\\).\nAn estimator that is both unbiased, and has the least variance of any unbiased estimator, is called the best or most efficient unbiased estimator.",

At \\(n=∞\\), we should expect our sample distribution to “collapse”, with only one potential outcome, the actual value of \\(\\theta\\) in the population.\n\\[\n\\P (|\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta| &gt; \\epsilon) \\rightarrow 0, \\quad \\mathrm{as} \\ n \\rightarrow ∞\n\\]\nWhat the above formula essentially states is that the difference between our estimate \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) and the actual population \\(\\theta\\) is greater than some arbitrarily small value \\(\\epsilon\\) with 0 probability asymptotically.\n\n\nNote that an estimator can be biased in finite samples, but consistent/unbiased in asymptotic samples. This implies that as we increase our sample size, the bias of this type of estimator will decrease.\nOne of the principles establishing asymptotic consistency is the law of large numbers, which shows that the sample average estimator is asymptotically consistent.\n\nTheorem 2.1 (Law of Large Numbers) The law of large numbers says that the sample average of a random sample is a asymptotically consistent estimator of the population mean. In other words, if we have a sample of \\(x_1, \\dots, x_n\\), the sample mean \\(\\bar x_n\\) has the property\n\\[\n\\mathrm{plim}(\\bar x_n) = \\mu_X\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\mathrm{plim}\\) stats that as \\(n \\rightarrow ∞\\), the probability distribution of the sample estimator \\(\\bar x_n\\) collapses around the true mean \\(\\mu_X\\).\n\n\nProof: Let us restate the sample mean estimator by its formula (definition of average):\n\\[\n\\bar x_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n x_t\n\\]\nNow, let us find the variance of this sample estimator \\(\\bar x_n\\).\n\\[\n\\V \\bar x_n = \\V \\left( \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n x_t \\right)\n\\]\nUsing the properties of variance in ?thm-variance, we establish that the above is\n\\[\n\\V \\bar x_n= \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^2 \\V \\left(\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n x_t \\right)\n\\]\nLet us define the variance of our sample \\(x_1 \\dots, x_n\\) as \\(\\V x_t = \\sigma^2\\). We get\n\\[\n\\V \\bar x_n = \\frac{1}{n^2} n\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sigma^2\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nAnd if sample size \\(n \\rightarrow ∞\\), we have a limit:\n\\[\n\\lim\\limits_{n \\rightarrow ∞} \\V \\bar x_n = \\lim\\limits_{n \\rightarrow ∞} \\frac{1}{n}\\sigma^2 = 0\n\\]\nThus, we can see the variance becomes 0, and the estimator’s sampling distribution collapses to a single value. This law will be used frequently in proving asymptotic properties, since many different parameters (such as variance and covariance for example) involve expectations/averages.",

Let us say the true mean \\(\\E Z_i = \\mu_Z\\), and the true variance \\(\\sigma^2_Z = \\V Z_i\\).\nConsider the sample average \\(\\bar z_n\\), and its variance \\(\\V \\bar z_n = \\sigma^2_Z/n\\) (from eq. 2.1). Now, let us define a new variable \\(W_n\\), which is \\(\\bar z_n\\) standardised (from ?eq-standardisation). The central limit theorem states that \\(w_n\\) is normally distributed as sample size \\(n \\rightarrow ∞\\):\n\\[\nW_n  = \\frac{\\bar z_n - \\mu}{\\sigma_Z / \\sqrt{n}} \\sim \\mathcal N(0, 1) \\quad \\mathrm{as} \\ n \\rightarrow ∞\n\\]\nThis property holds no matter the original distribution of \\(Z_i\\) or \\(\\bar z_n\\).\n\n\nThe central limit theorem says that as our sample size becomes larger and larger, our sample means estimator \\(\\bar z_n\\)’s standardised version \\(W_n\\) will be standardly normally distributed.\nIf we recall previously, the standard normal distribution has a probability density function of:\n\\[\n\\varphi(z) = f_Z(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}z^2}\n\\]\nThis means that if we have a sufficiently large sample size such that we can invoke the central limit theorem, we can calculate the exact probability of our sample estimate \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) being the outcome of the random variable of the sampling distribution, by using the probability density function defined in ?def-pdf.\nThis ability to calculate the probability of our realised sample estimate \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) allows us to conduct statistical inference with hypothesis testing, which we will introduce below.",

    "text": "2.7 Hypothesis Testing\nScience is about disproving a status-quo belief about a parameter \\(\\theta\\), and proving a new theory. We call the status-quo belief the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\), and our new theory the alternate hypothesis \\(H_1\\).\nFor example, your status quo theory might be that there is no relationship between education and income \\(\\theta = 0\\). Your alternate hypothesis is that there is a relatinoship between education and income \\(\\theta ≠ 0\\).\nHow can we “disprove” the status quo theory and conclude our alternate hypothesis is correct? What we essentially do is first assume that the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. We then gather a sample, and create a sample estimate \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\). We then calculate the probability of getting a sample estimate \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\), assuming that the null hypothesis is true.\nIf the probability of getting our specific sample estimate \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) is very low, we typically conclude that assuming the status quo theory \\(H_0\\) is incorrect, and our alternative hypothesis \\(H_1\\), our \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) would actually be more plausible.\nTo run a hypothesis test of this sort, we take a series of steps. First, we define our null and alternate hypotheses:\n\nNull hypothesis \\(H_0 : \\theta = \\theta_0\\).\nAlternate hypothesis \\(H_1 : \\theta ≠ \\theta_0\\)\n\nSecond, we have to calculate our test statistic. The actual test statistic (t-statistic, z-statistic, wald statistic) used depends on our estimator/sampling distribution. We will specify which test statistic to use for every estimator when we introduce specific estimators. However, every test statistic is calculated in the same way:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{test \\ statistic} = \\frac{\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta_0}{se(\\hat\\theta_n)}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) is our sample estimate, \\(\\theta_0\\) is the null hypothesis belief of the true value of \\(\\theta\\), and \\(se(\\hat\\theta_n)\\) is the standard deviation of our sampling distribution (square root of variance). The test statistic is measuring the distance in standard errors between \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) and \\(\\theta_0\\).\nThen, once we have a test statistic, we go to a standard normal distribution (or t-distribution or \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution, depending on the test). We start from the expectation of this distribution, then go test-statistic-number-of-units to both sides of the expectation. We then highlight the areas further from the expectation on both sides. The figure below illustrates this with a test statistic of 2.228.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we calculate the probability of the highlighted areas using the probability density function of the distribution we are using. This step is typically done with a calculator/computer since integrals are complex to compute.\nThe probability we get is called the p-value. The p-value describes the probability of getting a test statistic as or more extreme than the one we got, assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\theta = \\theta_0\\) is true.\nIf the p-value is below 0.05 (5%), we believe that it is unlikely that the null hypothesis is true, so we reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) and conclude our alternate hypothesis \\(H_1\\) is true. If the p-value is above 0.05 (5%), we have no evidence to reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\), so we still remain with the status quo \\(H_0\\).\nNote that you do not need to choose a 5% significance level - although that is the standard in many social science field and computer software.",

The true values of \\(\\b\\theta\\) in the population is called the estimand.\n\nDefinition 2.2 (Estimand) The estimand is \\(\\theta\\), the true population value of some parameter.

For example, let us say we are interested in people’s heights \\(Y\\) in the UK. For simplicity, assume a DGP of \\(Y_i \\sim \\mathcal N(\\mu_Y, \\sigma^2_Y)\\). We want to find \\(\\theta = \\mu_Y\\), the average height of all people in the UK. How can we do this?\nOf course, we could ask all 70 million people in the UK, and find the average. But clearly that would take an enormous amount of effort and resources to ask 70 million people. In some future applications we will discuss, the population is hypothetical, so asking the whole population is not even an option with unlimited resources.\nThe answer to this issue is sampling. We randomly take a subset of the population (let us say 1,000 people out of the 70 million), and then calculate the sample average height \\(\\bar Y\\).\nIf we believe that our sample is representative/similar to the population, then we might be able to say something about the population average height \\(\\mu_Y\\) from our sample average \\(\\bar Y\\). This procedure is called the estimator, and produces an estimate \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) of our true population.\n\nDefinition 2.3 (Estimator and Estimates) The estimator is a procedure/process to turn sample data, into an estimate \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) of our true population estimand \\(\\theta\\). For example, taking a sample and calculating the mean \\(\\bar Y\\) is a estimator of the true mean \\(\\mu_Y\\).\n\n\nA lot of statistics is about trying to find a good estimator in order to accurately (to the best of our ability) estimate the true population estimand \\(\\theta\\).

MLE also does not have to meet spherical errors, and only needs to meet the assumptions of i.i.d. and exogeneity (proper model specification).\nIn statistics, to estimate the population parameters \\(\\b\\theta\\), we gather some sample of observations \\((y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n)\\). Our random sample \\((y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n)\\) are each realisations of a random variable (our random selection from the population) \\(Y_1, Y_2, \\dots, Y_n\\).\nWhat is the probability that we draw \\(y_1\\) from our random variable \\(Y_1\\)?

Thus, the probability of drawing \\(y_1\\) is:\n\\[\n\\P(Y_1 = y_1) = f_{Y_1}(y_1)\n\\]\nHowever, our probability density function \\(f_{Y_1}\\) is determined by a set of parameters. For example, if \\(Y_1\\) is normally distributed \\(Y_1 \\sim \\mathcal N(\\mu_{Y_1}, \\sigma^2_{Y_1})\\), then the probability density function \\(f_{Y_1}\\) is determined by parameters \\(\\b \\theta = (\\mu_{Y_1}, \\sigma^2_{Y_1})\\). To represent this fact, in MLE, we will put the unknown parameters as a second input in our probability density function:\n\\[\n\\P(Y_1 = y_1) = f_{Y_1}(y_1; \\b \\theta)\n\\]\nSimilarly, the probability of drawing \\(y_2\\) from \\(Y_2\\) is \\(f_{Y_2}(y_2; \\b \\theta)\\), and the probability of drawing \\(y_t\\) from \\(Y_t\\) is \\(f_{Y_t}(y_t; \\b \\theta)\\).\nOkay, we know the probability of drawing any observation \\(y_t\\) from \\(Y_t\\) But, what is the probability of drawing the exact sample \\((y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n)\\) that we got? Or more mathematically, what is the probability of\n\\[\n\\P(Y_1 = y_1, \\ Y_2 = y_2, \\ \\dots, \\ Y_n = y_n)\n\\]\nWell, we know that if random variables are independent (?def-independence) of each other (i.e. drawing \\(y_1\\) doesn’t affect the probability of drawing \\(y_2\\)), the joint probability density function is just all the product of all the PDFs. Thus, if \\(Y_1, \\dots, Y_n\\) are independent random variables, we know the joint probability density function is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nf_{Y_1, \\dots , Y_n}(y_1, \\dots, y_n; \\ \\b\\theta ) & = f_{Y_1}(y_1; \\b\\theta) f_{Y_2}(y_2; \\b\\theta) \\dots f_{Y_n}(y_n; \\b\\theta) \\\\\n& = \\prod\\limits_{t=1}^nf_{Y_t}(y_t; \\b\\theta)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAnd this joint probability density function gives us the exact probability of getting our exact sample \\((y_1, \\dots, y_n)\\) through random sampling.

    "text": "5.2 Maximum Likelihood\nIn the above section, we defined the likelihood function (definition 5.1) as the likelihood of getting the exact sample we got, given the population parameters \\(\\b\\theta\\).\nThe maximum likelihood estimator is the idea that we should estimate our parameters \\(\\hat{\\b\\theta}\\) as the values of the parameters that maximise the likelihood we observe our specific sample \\(y_1, y_2, \\dots y_n\\).\nThe reason is because if there was a set of potential parameter values \\(\\b\\theta^*\\) that had a low chance of producing our sample \\(y_1, \\dots, y_n\\), we probably would not get our exact sample \\(y_1, \\dots, y_n\\). Since we would probably not get the exact sample we got, we either got really unlucky, or that set of potential parameter values \\(\\b\\theta^*\\) is wrong.\nBut if there was a set of potential parameter values \\(\\b\\theta^*\\) that was likely to produce our exact sample \\(y_1, \\dots, y_n\\), we have a good chance we actually getting our exact sample \\(y_1, \\dots, y_n\\). Thus, we want to find the set of parameters \\(\\hat{\\b\\theta}\\) that maximise our chances of observing our specific sample \\(y_1 \\dots, y_n\\).\nTo find the set of parameters \\(\\hat{\\b\\theta}\\) that maximise the likelihood we observe our specific sample, we need to find values of \\(\\b\\theta\\) that maximise our likelihood function \\(L(\\b \\theta, \\b y)\\). Thus our goal is\n\\[\n\\hat{\\b\\theta} = \\max\\limits_{\\b\\theta} L(\\b\\theta; \\b y)\n\\]\nHowever, this maximisation problem is quite difficult, as the likelihood function (definition 5.1) is a product. Finding the derivative of a product is not straight forward.\nLuckily, we have an alternative, the log-likelihood function \\(\\ell(\\b\\theta ; \\b y)\\), since the same \\(\\b\\theta\\) values that maximise \\(L\\) will also maximise \\(\\ell\\). The log-likelihood function can be derived by taking the log of the likelihood function\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\ell(\\b \\theta; \\b y) & = \\log L(\\b \\theta; \\b y) \\\\\n& = \\log\\left( \\prod\\limits_{t=1}^n f_{Y_t}(y_t; \\b\\theta)\\right) \\\\\n& = \\log[ f_{Y_1}(y_1, \\b\\theta) f_{Y_2}(y_2; \\b\\theta) \\dots f_{Y_n}(y_n; \\b\\theta) ]\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAnd using the property of logs that \\(\\log(ab) = \\log a + \\log b\\), we can determine\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\ell(\\b \\theta; \\b y) & = \\log(f_{Y_1}(y_1; \\b\\theta)) + \\log(f_{Y_2}(y_2; \\b\\theta)) + \\dots + f_{Y_n}(y_n; \\b\\theta) \\\\\n& = \\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n\\log (f_{Y_t}(y_t; \\b\\theta))\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nDefinition 5.2 (Log-Likelihood Function) The log-likelihood function \\(\\ell\\) is the log of the likelihood function \\(L\\) (definition 5.1). The log-likelihood function takes the form\n\\[\n\\ell(\\b \\theta; \\b y) = \\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n\\log (f_{Y_t}(y_t; \\b\\theta))\n\\]\nWe can also write this in terms of vector \\(\\b y\\) containing all observations of the sample:\n\\[\n\\ell(\\b \\theta; \\b y)  = \\log(f_Y(\\b y; \\ \\b\\theta))\n\\]\n\n\nThe summation notation in the log-likelihood makes it far easier to maximise by finding the derivative. Thus, in most applications, we will deal with the log-likelihood function for estimation purposes.",

    "text": "5.3 Score Function\nThe gradient of the log-likelihood \\(\\ell(\\b\\theta; \\b y)\\) in respect to vector \\(\\b\\theta\\) is the score function.\n\nDefinition 5.3 (Score Function) The score function \\(s\\) is given by:\n\\[\ns(\\b\\theta; \\b y) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\b\\theta} \\ell(\\b\\theta; \\b y) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\b\\theta}  \\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n \\log(f_{Y_t}(y_t; \\b\\theta))\n\\]\nWe can also write this in terms of vector \\(\\b y\\) containing all observations of the sample:\n\\[\ns(\\b\\theta; \\b y) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\b\\theta} \\log(f_Y(\\b y; \\b\\theta))\n\\]\n\n\nAs we know through calculus, to maximise a function, we set the gradient equal to zero. Thus, the estimates \\(\\hat{\\b\\theta}\\) of maximum likelihood estimation are the set of \\(\\b\\theta\\) that make \\(s(\\b\\theta; \\b y) = 0\\).\nLet us define the true parameter value in the population as \\(\\b\\theta_0\\). That means, the true score function of \\(\\b\\theta_0\\) is \\(s(\\b\\theta_0; \\b y)\\).\nVector \\(\\b y\\), our sample, is the reasliation of a set of random variables as we described earlier. Thus, the true population parameter \\(\\b\\theta_0\\)’s score function \\(s(\\b\\theta_0, \\b y)\\) is actually also a random variable in respect to random \\(\\b y\\). This means the true population parameter score function \\(s(\\b\\theta_0, \\b y)\\) has a expectation and variance.\n\nTheorem 5.1 The expectation of the true population parameter \\(\\b\\theta\\)’s score function is 0.\n\\[\n\\E(s(\\b\\theta_0; \\b y)) = 0\n\\]\n\n\nProof: Let us first start with the definition of expectation of a continuous variable (?def-exp). That means we can deduce\n\\[\n\\E(s(\\b\\theta_0; \\b y)) = \\int \\underbrace{s(\\b\\theta_0; \\b y)}_{\\mathrm{s \\ given} \\ \\b y} \\overbrace{f_Y(\\b y ; \\b\\theta)}^{\\P(Y=\\b y)} dy\n\\]\nNow, let us plug in the score function (definition 5.3):\n\\[\n\\E(s(\\b\\theta_0; \\b y)) = \\int\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\b\\theta}\\log f_Y(\\b y; \\b\\theta)\\right] f_Y(\\b y; \\b\\theta)\n\\]\nUsing the derivative rule \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\log u(x) = \\frac{u'(x)}{u(x)}\\), we get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\E(s(\\b\\theta_0; \\b y)) & = \\int\\frac{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\b\\theta} f_Y(\\b y; \\b \\theta)}{f_Y(\\b y; \\b \\theta)}f_Y(\\b y; \\b \\theta) \\\\\n& = \\int \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\b\\theta} f_Y(\\b y; \\b \\theta)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe can flip the derivative and anti-derivative to get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\E(s(\\b\\theta_0; \\b y)) & =  \\frac{\\partial} {\\partial\\b\\theta} \\int f_Y(\\b y; \\b \\theta) \\\\\n& = \\frac{\\partial} {\\partial\\b\\theta} 1 \\ = \\ 0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAnd the last step is because the integral (are under the curve) of a PDF is always 1 (the entire probability space). Thus, we see that the expectation of the score function at true population parameter \\(\\b\\theta_0\\) in respect to random vector \\(\\b y\\) is 0.",

    "section": "3.2 The Classical Assumptions",
    "text": "3.2 The Classical Assumptions\nA model of the data generating process is only considered to be a classical linear model (and thus allow for the ordinary least squares estimator) if it meets a set of assumptions.\n\nAssumption 1: Linearity in Parameters\nThe model must be able to be written in the form of \\(\\b y = \\b{X\\beta} + \\b \\eps\\). This implies that no parameters \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) can be multiplied to each other. Note that this assumption does not mean the actual function must be linear. For example, take this following model\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i + \\beta_2X_i^2 + \\eps_i\n\\]\nThis would actually still be linear in parameters, since no \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) are being multiplied. We can see that if we pretend \\(X_{i2} = X_i^2\\), we can write this in the form \\(\\b y = \\b{X\\beta} + \\b\\eps\\).\n\n\nAssumption 2: Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.)\nEach individual in the population \\(i\\)’s \\(Y_i\\) value, \\(y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n\\), must be a result of random variables \\(Y_1, \\dots, Y_n\\) in which all of these random variables are independent of each other by definition 1.4, and have the exact same distribution with each other.\n\n\nAssumption 3: No Perfect Multicollinearity\nNo explanatory variables \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) can be perfectly correlated with any other explanatory variable, or perfectly correlated with any linear combination of other explanatory variables. This assumption is required for estimation to be possible with the ordinary least squares estimator, as it requires matrix \\(\\b X\\) to be full rank which allows \\(\\b X^\\top \\b X\\) to be invertable.\n\n\nAssumption 4: Strict Exogeneity\nThis condition is \\(\\E(\\b\\eps | \\b X) = 0\\). This can be broken into two parts:\n\n\\(\\E(\\b\\eps) = 0\\). The mean of the error term should be equal to 0. This is usually not an issue, because if it is an issue, we can adjust \\(\\beta_0\\)’s value until this is not an issue.\n\\(\\E(\\b X^\\top \\b\\eps) = 0\\). This implies that all regressors \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) should be uncorrelated with the error terms \\(\\eps\\), and any linear combination of \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) should be uncorrelated with the error term.\n\n\n\nAssumption 5: Spherical Errors\nThis assumption is made on the structure of the variance-covariance matrix \\(\\V(\\b\\eps|\\b X)\\) of the error terms. The variance-covariance matrix is defined as\n\\[\n\\V(\\b\\eps | \\b X) = \\b\\Omega = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\V \\eps_1 & Cov(\\eps_1, \\eps_2) & Cov(\\eps_1, \\eps_3) & \\dots \\\\\nCov(\\eps_2, \\eps_1) & \\V \\eps_2 & Cov(\\eps_2, \\eps_3) & \\dots \\\\\nCov(\\eps_3, \\eps_1) & Cov(\\eps_3, \\eps_2) & \\V\\eps_3 & \\vdots \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\dots & \\ddots\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\tag{3.6}\\]\nAnd spherical errors says that this variance-covariance matrix should look like\n\\[\n\\V(\\b\\eps|\\b X) = \\sigma^2 \\b I_n = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma^2 & 0 & 0 & \\dots \\\\\n0 & \\sigma^2 & 0 & \\dots  \\\\\n0 & 0& \\sigma^2 & \\vdots \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\dots & \\ddots\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\tag{3.7}\\]\nSpherical errors implies two smaller assumptions:\n\nNo Autocorrelation: This means that the covariance of any two error terms \\(Cov(\\eps_i, \\eps_j) = 0\\). This is reflected in spherical errors with all the 0’s in the non-diagonal positions. This assumption is generally met if we meet the i.i.d. assumption.\nHomoscedasticity: This means that every error term \\(\\eps_i\\) for any observation \\(i\\) has the same variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). The variance of the error \\(\\eps_i\\) does not depend on the values of \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\). If this condition is violated, as in each observation \\(i\\) has their own variance \\(\\sigma^2_i\\), we call this homoscedasticity.\n\nYou will probably notice that these assumptions can be quite restrictive. In the following chapters, we will explore alternative estimators for when we weaken these conditions.",

One logical way is to see what values of \\(\\b{\\hat\\beta}\\) will produce the closest predictions of \\(\\b y\\) values to the actual sample values.\nWe can define our predicted \\(\\b y\\) values as \\(\\hat{\\b y} = \\b X \\hat{\\b\\beta}\\). Our prediction does not include the error term \\(\\b\\eps\\) because based on the strict exogeneity assumption, \\(\\E(\\b\\eps) = 0\\).\nOrdinary Least Squares estimator is an estimation process that finds the values our estimates \\(\\hat{\\b\\beta}\\) by the \\(\\hat{\\b\\beta}\\) values that minimise the sum of squared residuals (SSR), which is the difference between \\(\\b y\\) and predicted \\(\\hat{\\b y}\\) squared.\n\nDefinition 3.4 (Sum of Squared Residuals) We will define the SSR by function \\(S(\\hat{\\b\\beta})\\):\n\\[\nS(\\hat{\\b\\beta}) = (\\b y - \\hat{\\b y})^\\top (\\b y - \\hat{\\b y})\n\\]\nOr in summation notation:\n\\[\nS(\\hat{\\b\\beta}) = \\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n(Y_t - \\hat Y_t)^2\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Sum of Squared Residuals?\n\n\n\n\n\nOne common question is why are we squaring the residuals (difference between \\(\\b y\\) and \\(\\hat{\\b y}\\)). The main reason is that squaring gets rid of negative and positive residuals, which might cancel each other out. We do not care about the direction of residuals/errors, only the magnitude.\nThe reason we choose to square the residuals, and not to use absolute value, is because of a variety of unique properties of OLS (unbiasedness, variance, efficeincy) that we will explore throughout this chapter.\n\n\n\nWe know that predicted \\(\\hat{\\b y} = \\b X \\hat{\\b \\beta}\\). Thus, let us plug that into the above, and simplify to get:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nS(\\hat{\\b\\beta}) & = (\\b y - \\b X \\hat{\\b\\beta})^\\top (\\b y - \\b X \\hat{\\b\\beta}) \\\\\n& = \\b y^\\top \\b y - \\hat{\\b\\beta}^\\top \\b X^\\top \\b y - \\b y^\\top \\b X \\hat{\\b\\beta} +  \\hat{\\b\\beta}^\\top \\b{X^\\top X} \\hat{\\b\\beta}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAnd using the properties of transposes, we can combine \\(- \\hat{\\b\\beta}^\\top \\b X^\\top \\b y - \\b y^\\top \\b X \\hat{\\b\\beta}\\) into \\(-2 \\hat{\\b\\beta}^\\top \\b{X^\\top y}\\), and thus, we get\n\\[\nS(\\hat{\\b\\beta}) = \\b y^\\top \\b y - 2 \\hat{\\b\\beta}^\\top \\b{X^\\top y} + \\underbrace{\\hat{\\b\\beta}^\\top \\b{X^\\top X} \\hat{\\b\\beta}}_{\\text{quadratic term}}\n\\]\nNow, we want to maximise in respect to \\(\\hat{\\b\\beta}\\), so let us take the gradient of function \\(S\\) in respect to \\(\\hat{\\b\\beta}\\), and set it equal to 0.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\hat{\\b\\beta}} = -2 \\b{X^\\top y} + 2 \\b{X^\\top X} \\hat{\\b\\beta} = 0\n\\]\nNow, solving for \\(\\hat{\\b\\beta}\\), we can first move \\(-2\\b{X^\\top y}\\) to the right side, and then use matrix inversion to isolate \\(\\hat{\\b\\beta}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n2 \\b{X^\\top X}\\hat{\\b\\beta} & = 2 \\b{X^\\top y} \\\\\n\\hat{\\b\\beta} & = (2 \\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}2 \\b{X^\\top y} \\\\\n\\hat{\\b\\beta} & =  (2^{-1})2(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b{X^\\top y} \\\\\n\\hat{\\b\\beta} & =  (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b{X^\\top y}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAnd we have derived our OLS estimates of parameters \\(\\hat{\\b\\beta}\\).\n\nDefinition 3.5 (OLS Estimate) The OLS estimate of parameters \\(\\b\\beta\\) is:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\b\\beta} =  (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b{X^\\top y}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Matrix Derivation for Simple Linear Regression\n\n\n\n\n\nFor simple linear regression, our sum of squared errors (definition 3.4) is:\n\\[\nS(\\hat\\beta_0, \\hat\\beta_1) = \\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n (Y_t - \\hat\\beta_0 - \\hat\\beta_1 X_t)^2\n\\]\nOur first order conditions by taking the partial derivative in respect to \\(\\hat\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\) are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\hat\\beta_0} = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n (Y_t -\\hat\\beta_0 = \\hat\\beta X_t) = 0 \\\\\n& \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\hat\\beta_1} = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n X_t (Y_t -\\hat\\beta_0 = \\hat\\beta X_t) = 0 \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAnd the final solutions for \\(\\hat\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\) after solving this system of equations is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\hat\\beta_0 = \\bar Y - \\hat\\beta_1 \\bar X \\\\\n& \\hat\\beta_1 = \\frac{\\sum (X_t -\\bar X)(Y_t -\\bar Y)}{\\sum (X_t - \\bar X)^2} = \\frac{Cov(X, Y)}{\\V Y}\n\\end{align}\n\\]",

Thus,\n\\[\n\\b{P^\\top M} = \\b{PM}\n\\]\nNow, let us substitute the definition of \\(\\b M\\) from (definition 3.7), to get :\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\b{P^\\top M} & = \\b P( \\b I - \\b P) \\\\\n& = \\b P - \\b{PP}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAnd since \\(\\b P\\) is idempotent, i.e. \\(\\b{PP} = \\b P\\), then we know that\n\\[\n\\b{P^\\top M} = \\b P - \\b P = 0\n\\]\nThus proving \\(\\b P\\) and \\(\\b M\\) are orthogonal.\n\n\n\nNow, recall our predictions \\(\\hat{\\b y} = \\b X \\hat{\\b\\beta}\\). Using our OLS solution, and the plugging in the definition of projection matrix \\(\\color{red}{\\b P}\\) (definition 3.6), we can find\n\\[\n\\hat{\\b y} = \\b X (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1} \\b{X^\\top y} = \\color{red}{\\b P}\\color{black}{\\b y}\n\\]\nNow, let us look at our residuals \\(\\hat{\\b \\eps} = \\b y - \\hat{\\b y}\\). By plogging in \\(\\b y = \\b{Py}\\) from above, and substituting the definition of \\(\\color{purple}{\\b M}\\) (definition 3.7), we can get:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\b\\eps} = \\b y - \\color{red}{\\b P} \\color{black}{\\b y} = (\\b I - \\color{red}{\\b P}\\color{black})\\b y = \\color{purple}{\\b M} \\color{black}{\\b y}\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\nWe can see that projection matrix \\(\\color{red}{\\b P}\\) performs a linear mapping of \\(\\b y \\rightarrow \\hat{\\b y}\\), hence why it is called the “projection” matrix. We can see that residual maker matrix \\(\\color{purple}{\\b M}\\) performs a linear mapping of \\(\\b y \\rightarrow \\hat{\\b\\eps}\\), thus “making” the residuals \\(\\hat{\\b\\eps}\\).\nWe know that our predictsion \\(\\hat{\\b y}\\) are a linear combination of our explanatory variable vectors \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\), since \\(\\hat{\\b y} = \\b X \\hat{\\b\\beta}\\). This means that projection matrix \\(\\color{red}{\\b P}\\) projects \\(\\b y\\) into \\(\\hat{\\b y}\\) which is in the space spanned by our \\(\\b X\\) (called the column space of \\(\\b X\\)).\nThis is visualised in the figure below, where observed vector \\(\\b y\\) is projected into the blue space of regressors \\(\\b X\\) to create vector \\(\\hat{\\b y}\\):\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see as well that residual maker \\(\\color{purple}{\\b M}\\) projects vector \\(\\b y\\) into vector \\(\\b\\eps\\), which is in the space orthogonal/perpendicular to the column space of \\(\\b X\\). This is why our condition of strict exogeneity (definition 3.2) is required - there should be no correlation between \\(\\b X\\) and \\(\\b \\eps\\) as they are orthogonal by design.\nThis idea of projection means we can measure the fit of our model with the correlation/overlap between original vector \\(\\b y\\) and our predicted values vector \\(\\hat{\\b y} = \\b{Py}\\).\n\nDefinition 3.8 (R-Squared) \\(R^2\\) is a metric to measure the fit of our model. It is defined as:\n\\[\nR^2 = \\frac{\\overbrace{\\b{y^\\top Py}}^{\\text{model}}}{\\underbrace{\\b{y^\\top y}}_{\\V Y}} \\ = \\ 1-\\frac{\\overbrace{\\sum(Y_t - \\hat Y_t)^2}^{\\text{SSR}}}{\\underbrace{\\sum (Y_t - \\bar Y)^2}_{\\V Y}}\n\\]\n\\(R^2\\) is always between 0 and 1, and measures the proportion of variance our model with explanatory variables \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) explains the variation in \\(Y\\).",

    "text": "3.4 Regression Anatomy\nSo we now know how to derive OLS estimates \\(\\hat{\\b \\beta}\\), and we know the projection interpretation of OLS. But what does \\(\\b{\\hat\\beta}\\) actually mean? What does estimating these parameters tell us about the data generating process and the real-world? To understand the parameter estimates of OLS, we want to study the partitioned regression model.\n\nDefinition 3.9 (Partitioned Regression Model) A partitioned regression model is when we split up our matrices/vectors in our classical linear model \\(\\b y = \\b{X\\beta} + \\b\\eps\\).\nLet us say we only care about some of the explanatory variables in our data generating process. We can split matrix \\(\\b X\\) into two: \\(\\b X_1\\) contains the explanatory variables we care about, and \\(\\b X_2\\) contains the other explanatory variables. Similarly, we divide \\(\\b\\beta\\) into \\(\\b\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\b\\beta_2\\) in the same way. We can write our new regression model as:\n\\[\n\\b y = \\b X_1 \\b\\beta_1 + \\b X_2 \\b\\beta_2 + \\b\\eps\n\\]\n\n\nRecall the residual maker matrix \\(\\b M\\) (definition 3.7), and recall how \\(\\b M\\) is orthogonal to \\(\\b X\\), meaning \\(\\b{MX} = 0\\).\nNow, let us consider only the residual maker matrix of the second part of our partitioned model \\(\\b M_2\\), which means \\(\\b M_2 \\b X_2 = 0\\). Let us take our partitioned regression model, and pre-multiply \\(\\b M_2\\) to both sides:\n\\[\n\\b M_2 \\b y = \\b M_2(\\b X_1 \\b\\beta_1 + \\b X_2 \\b\\beta_2 + \\b\\eps)\n\\]\nNow, let us distribute out to get\n\\[\n\\b M_2 \\b y = \\b M_2 \\b X_1 \\b\\beta_1 + \\b M_2 \\b X_2 \\b\\beta_2 + \\b M_2 \\b\\eps\n\\]\nNow recall that \\(\\b M_2 \\b X_2 = 0\\). That means we can simplify the above to\n\\[\n\\b M_2 \\b y = \\b M_2 \\b X_1 \\b\\beta_1  + \\b M_2 \\b\\eps\n\\]\nNow, let us define \\(\\tilde{\\b y} := \\b M_2 \\b y\\), \\(\\tilde{\\b X_1} := \\b M_2 \\b X_1\\), and error \\(\\tilde{\\b\\eps} = \\b M_2 \\b\\eps\\). We can rewrite as\n\\[\n\\tilde{\\b y} = \\tilde{\\b X_1}\\b\\beta_1 + \\tilde{\\b \\eps}\n\\]\nRemember, since we multiplied \\(\\b M_2\\) to both sides, this above model is equivalent to that of our partitioned model and our original regression model. Using definition 3.5, we know the OLS estimate of \\(\\hat{\\b \\beta_1}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\b\\beta}_1 = (\\tilde{\\b X_1^\\top} \\tilde{\\b X_1}) \\tilde{\\b X_1^\\top} \\tilde{\\b y}\n\\tag{3.3}\\]\nThis OLS estimate of \\(\\hat{\\b\\beta}_1\\) is the same as if we had calculated our OLS estimates normally without partitioning the model.\nWhat does this tell us? Notice how we have \\(\\tilde{\\b X_1} := \\b M_2 \\b X_1\\) in our formula. Well, we know \\(\\b M_2 \\b X_2 = 0\\). That means that any part of \\(\\b X_1\\) that was correlated to \\(\\b X_2\\) became 0, after it was multiplied by \\(\\b M_2\\). Thus, \\(\\tilde{\\b X_1}\\) is the part of \\(\\b X_1\\) that is uncorrelated with \\(\\b X_2\\). We see that our OLS estimates are calculated in respect to \\(\\tilde{\\b X_1}\\).\n\nTheorem 3.1 (Regression Anatomy Theorem) Our individual parameter estimates \\(\\hat\\beta_j \\in \\{\\hat\\beta_1, \\dots, \\hat\\beta_p \\}\\) are the relationship between \\(Y\\) and the part of \\(X_j \\in \\{X_1, \\dots, X_p\\}\\) uncorrelated with the other explanatory variables.\n\n\nEssentially we are partialling out the effect of other variables in our coefficient estimates. This is why we you will hear people “control” for other variables in linear models.",

    "text": "3.7 Gauss-Markov Theorem\nYou might have noticed that the OLS estimator is quite restrictive in terms of the assumptions needed for it to apply. So then, what makes us want to use the OLS estimator? The answer is the Gauss-Markov Theorem.\n\nTheorem 3.4 (Gauss-Markov) If all of the assumptions of linearity, i.i.d., no perfect multicollinearity, strict exogeneity, and spherical errors are all met, then the Ordinary Least Squares estimator is the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) - the unbiased linear estimator with the lowest variance of any other unbiased estimator.\nFormally, if \\(\\hat{\\b\\beta}\\) is the OLS estimator, and \\(\\tilde{\\b\\beta}\\) is any other linear unbiased estimator, then\n\\[\n\\V(\\hat{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) ≤ \\V(\\tilde{\\b\\beta} | \\b X)\n\\]\n\n\nAny linear estimator \\(\\tilde{\\b\\beta}\\) must be in the form \\(\\tilde{\\b\\beta} = \\b{Cy}\\), where \\(\\b C\\) is some linear mapping. For example, using projection matrix \\(\\b P\\) (definition 3.6), OLS can be written as \\(\\hat{\\b\\beta} = \\b{Py}\\). Before we prove the Gauss-Markov theorem, we need a lemma about any unbiased linear estimator.\n\nLemma 3.1 For any linear estimator \\(\\tilde{\\b\\beta} = \\b{Cy}\\) to be unbiased, \\(\\b{CX} = \\b I\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof of Lemma 3.1\n\n\n\n\n\nProof: Let us start off with our linear estimator \\(\\tilde{\\b\\beta} = \\b{Cy}\\), and plug in the true linear model \\(\\b y = \\b{X\\beta} + \\b\\eps\\) into our linear estimator:\n\\[\n\\tilde{\\b\\beta} = \\b C (\\b{X\\beta} + \\b\\eps) = \\b{CX\\beta} + \\b{C\\eps}\n\\]\nNow, let us find the expected value of this estimator conditional on \\(\\b X\\). Remember that the expected values of constants (like \\(\\b C\\), \\(\\b \\beta\\), and \\(\\b X\\) since we are conditioning on \\(\\b X\\)) are the constants themselves.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\E(\\tilde{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) & = \\E(\\b{CX\\beta} + \\b{C\\eps}) \\\\\n& = \\b{CX\\beta} + \\b C \\E(\\b\\eps| \\b X)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFrom the strict exogeneity assumption (definition 3.2), we know \\(\\E(\\b\\eps | \\b X) = 0\\), so we can simplify to\n\\[\n\\E(\\tilde{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) = \\b{CX\\beta}\n\\]\nAnd using the law of iterated expectations (?thm-lie), we can find \\(\\E\\tilde{\\b\\beta}\\):\n\\[\n\\E\\tilde{\\b\\beta} = \\E[\\E(\\tilde{\\b\\beta}|\\b X)] = \\E[\\b{CX\\beta}] = \\b{CX\\beta}\n\\]\nFor unbiasedness (definition 2.4), we know \\(\\E\\tilde{\\b\\beta} = \\b\\beta\\). The only way \\(\\b{CX\\beta}\\) will equal \\(\\b\\beta\\) is if \\(\\b{CX} = \\b I\\). Thus, for any linear unbiased estimator, the lemma \\(\\b{CX} = \\b I\\) must hold.\n\n\n\nWith this lemma, now let us prove Gauss-Markov. First, let us calculate the variance of unbiased linear estimator \\(\\tilde{\\b\\beta}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\V(\\tilde{\\b\\beta} | \\b X) & = \\V(\\b{Cy} | \\b X) \\\\\n& = \\V(\\b C( \\b{X\\beta} + \\b \\eps)| \\b X) \\\\\n& = \\V(\\b{CX\\beta} + \\b{C\\eps} | \\b X)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAnd since we know from Lemma 3.1 that \\(\\b{CX = I}\\), we can get\n\\[\n\\V(\\tilde{\\b\\beta} | \\b X) = \\V(\\b\\beta + \\b{C\\eps} | \\b X)\n\\]\nWe know that \\(\\b\\beta\\) is a vector of fixed constants (the true population values). We also know \\(\\b C\\) is some fixed constant matrix (that depends on \\(\\b X\\), but we are conditioning on \\(\\b X\\)). Thus, we can use ?thm-variance to rewrite the above as\n\\[\n\\V(\\tilde{\\b\\beta} | \\b X) = \\b C\\V(\\b\\eps | \\b X) \\b C^\\top\n\\]\nNow, according to the assumption of spherical errors (definition 3.3), we know that \\(\\V(\\b \\eps| \\b X) = \\sigma^2 \\b I_n\\). Thus, let us plug that into our equation to get\n\\[\n\\V(\\tilde{\\b\\beta} | \\b X) = \\b C \\sigma^2 \\b I_n \\b C^\\top\n\\]\nSince \\(\\b I_n\\) is the identity matrix, it cancels out. For notation simplicity, we can move the scalar \\(\\sigma^2\\) to the front, and simplify:\n\\[\n\\V(\\tilde{\\b\\beta} | \\b X) = \\sigma^2 \\b{CC^\\top}\n\\tag{3.5}\\]\nNow we have the variance of estimator \\(\\tilde{\\b\\beta}\\). To prove Gauss-Markov, we need to show that the variance of \\(\\tilde{\\b\\beta}\\) is greater than the variance of \\(\\hat{\\b\\beta}\\). For this to be true,\n\\[\n\\V(\\tilde{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) - \\V(\\tilde{\\b\\beta}| \\b X) ≥ 0\n\\]\nWe can plug in the variance of \\(\\tilde{\\b\\beta}\\) from eq. 3.5, and the variance of OLS \\(\\hat{\\b\\beta}\\) from theorem 3.3:\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 \\b{CC^\\top} - \\sigma^2 (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1} ≥ 0\n\\]\nWe can factor out the \\(\\sigma^2\\) to get\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 (\\b{CC^\\top} - (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}) ≥ 0\n\\]\nWe know from Lemma 3.1 that \\(\\b{CX} = \\b I\\), which through the properties of tranposes, also implies that \\(\\b{X^\\top C^\\top} = (\\b{CX})^\\top = \\b I\\). Multipling by \\(\\b I\\) doesn’t change anything, so we can insert a \\(\\b{CX}\\) and \\(\\b{X^\\top C^\\top}\\) into our equation above to get\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 (\\b{CC^\\top} - \\b{CX} (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b{X^\\top C^\\top}) ≥ 0\n\\]\nFactoring out \\(\\b C\\) and \\(\\b C^\\top\\), and remembering our residual maker \\(\\b M\\) (definition 3.7),\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\sigma^2 \\b C(\\b I - \\b X(\\b{X^\\top X}^{-1}\\b X^\\top) \\b C^\\top & ≥ 0 \\\\\n\\sigma^2 \\b{CMC} & ≥ 0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe know \\(\\sigma^2\\), the variance of the error term, must be positive. \\(\\b{CMC}\\) is also a positive semi-definite matrix (behaves like a positive number). The proof is provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof \\(CMC\\) is Positive Semi-Definite\n\n\n\n\n\nTo show \\(\\b {CMC}\\) is positive semi-definite, the following must be true for every vector \\(\\b z\\):\n\\[\n\\b{z^\\top CMC^\\top z} ≥ 0\n\\]\nRemember that from definition 3.7 that \\(\\b M\\) is symmetric and idempotent. This implies that \\(\\b M = \\b{MM} = \\b M^\\top\\). Thus, plugging this in, we get\n\\[\n\\underbrace{\\b{z^\\top CM}}_{\\b w^\\top} \\underbrace{\\b{M^\\top C^\\top z}}_{\\b w} = \\b{w^\\top w} = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n w_i^2 ≥ 0\n\\]\nWhich is true since the square of any number cannot be negative. Thus, \\(\\b{CMC}\\) is positive semi-definite, and behaves like a positive number.\n\n\n\nThis property means that OLS produces the best estimates for any linear model, which makes it very popular in statistics (especially considering many statistical models are linear).",

    "text": "3.5 Finite Sample Properties\nWe know that an estimator has two finite sample properties: unbiasedness (described in definition 2.4) and variance (described in definition 2.5).\n\nTheorem 3.1 (OLS is an Unbiased Estimator) The Ordinary Least Squares estimator is an unbiased estimator under the assumptions of linearity, i.i.d., no perfect multicollinearity, and strict exogeneity.\n\\[\n\\E \\hat{\\b\\beta} = \\b\\beta\n\\]\nNote that the assumption of spherical errors is not needed for the unbiasedness of OLS.\n\n\nProof: Let us start with our OLS solution from definition 3.5, and plug in our original model \\(\\b y = \\b{X\\beta} + \\b\\eps\\) into where \\(\\b y\\) is in the OLS solution:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\b\\beta} & = (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1} \\b{X^\\top y} \\\\\n& = (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1} \\b X^\\top (\\b{X\\beta} + \\b\\eps) \\\\\n& = \\underbrace{(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b{X^\\top X}}_{\\text{inverses cancel}}\\b\\beta + (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1} \\b{X^\\top \\eps} \\\\\n& = \\b\\beta + (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b{X^\\top \\eps}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{3.4}\\]\nNow, let us take the expectation of \\(\\hat{\\b\\beta}\\) conditional on \\(\\b X\\) (remember that \\(\\b X\\) and \\(\\b \\beta\\) are fixed constants, so they are not affected by the expectation). We can use the strict exogeneity assumption from definition 3.2 to simplify:\n\\[\n\\E(\\hat{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) = \\b\\beta + (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1} \\underbrace{\\E (\\b \\eps | \\b X)}_{= \\ 0} = \\b\\beta\n\\]\nNow, we know \\(\\E(\\hat{\\b\\beta} | \\b X)\\). We can deduce \\(\\E(\\hat{\\b\\beta})\\) using the law of iterated expectations given in theorem 1.3, and plugging in \\(\\E(\\hat{\\b\\beta} | \\b X) = \\b\\beta\\):\n\\[\n\\E(\\hat{\\b\\beta}) = \\E[\\E(\\hat{\\b\\beta}|\\b X)] = \\E[\\b\\beta] = \\b\\beta\n\\]\nThe final step is because the expectation of a constant \\(\\b\\beta\\) (the fixed true population value) is the constant itself. Thus, we have proven OLS is an unbiased.\n\n\nTheorem 3.2 (Variance of the OLS Estimator) The variance of the OLS estimator under the assumptions of linearity, i.i.d., no perfect multicollinearity, strict exogeneity, and spherical errors, is given by\n\\[\n\\V(\\hat{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) = \\sigma^2 (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\n\\]\n\n\nProof: Let us start where we left off from eq. 3.4 during the proof of unbiasedness. This tells us the variance of the OLS estimator is:\n\\[\n\\V(\\hat{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) = \\V(\\b\\beta + (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1} \\b{X^\\top \\eps})\n\\]\nWe know that \\(\\b\\beta\\) is a vector of fixed true population values. \\((\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1} \\b X^\\top\\) can also be considered a fixed constant matrix because we are conditioning our variance on \\(\\b X\\). Thus, we can use theorem 1.2 to rewrite the above as\n\\[\n\\V(\\hat{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) = (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b X^\\top \\V(\\b\\eps| \\b X)[(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b X^\\top]^{-1}\n\\]\nWith the properties of matrix inverses and transposes, we can determine that \\([(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b X^\\top]^{-1}\\) is equivalent to \\(\\b X(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\). Thus, plugging this in, we get\n\\[\n\\V(\\hat{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) = (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b X^\\top \\V(\\b\\eps| \\b X) \\b X(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\n\\]\nNow, according to the assumption of spherical errors given in definition 3.4, we know that \\(\\V(\\b \\eps| \\b X) = \\sigma^2 \\b I_n\\). Thus, let us plug that into our equation to get\n\\[\n\\V(\\hat{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) = (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b X^\\top \\sigma^2 \\b I_n \\b X(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\b I_n\\) is the identity matrix, it cancels out. For notation simplicity, we can move the scalar \\(\\sigma^2\\) to the front, and simplify:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\V(\\hat{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) & = \\sigma^2 \\underbrace{(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b X^\\top \\b X}_{\\text{inverses cancel}}(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1} \\\\\n& = \\sigma^2 (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThus, we have proved that the variance of the OLS estimator is as the theorem above.",

    "text": "3.8 Asymptotics Properties\nBefore we introduce asymptotic properties of the OLS estimator, we have to introduce a new assumption: Weak exogeneity. Previously, we discussed definition 3.2. Weak exgoeneity is a weaker version of this assumption.\n\nDefinition 3.10 (Weak Exogeneity) Weak exogeneity is defined as \\(\\E(\\b x_i \\eps_i) = 0\\). Weak exogeneity only requires that regressors \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) individually are uncorrelated with the error term. Weak exogeneity allows for combinations of \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) to to be correlated with \\(\\eps\\), which is not allowed under strict exogeneity\n\n\nIf you meet strict exogeneity, you automatically meet the assumption of weak exogeneity. However, the opposite is not true - weak exogeneity does not imply strict exogeneity.\n\nTheorem 3.4 (Consistency of OLS) The Ordinary Least Squares estimator is asymptotically consistent as given by definition 2.6, under the assumptions of linearity, i.i.d., no perfect multicollinearity, weak exogeneity, and spherical errors.\nMathematically, this means\n\\[\n\\mathrm{plim}\\hat{\\b\\beta} = \\b\\beta\n\\]\n\nProof: Let us perform the same steps as in eq. 3.4, and start off where we left off. We can rewrite our matrix notation in the form of vectors, scalars, and summation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\b\\beta} & = \\b\\beta + (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b{X^\\top\\eps} \\\\\n& = \\b\\beta + \\left(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\b{x_i x_i^\\top}\\right)^{-1} \\left(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n\\b x_i \\eps_i \\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, let us do a little algebra trick as follows:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\b\\beta} = \\b\\beta + \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\b{x_i x_i^\\top}\\right)^{-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n\\b x_i \\eps_i \\right)\n\\]\nThe reason we can do this is because the first \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) is inversed as \\(\\frac{1}{n}^{-1}\\), so this cancels out the second one, maintaining the equality of our equation.\nNow, we want to prove \\(\\mathrm{plim}\\hat{\\b\\beta} =\\b\\beta\\), so let us take the probability limit of both sides.\n\\[\n\\mathrm{plim}\\hat{\\b\\beta} = \\mathrm{plim} \\b\\beta + \\left( \\mathrm{plim} \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\b{x_i x_i^\\top}\\right)^{-1} \\left( \\mathrm{plim}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n\\b x_i \\eps_i \\right)\n\\]\nWe know that the probability limit of a constant is itself, so \\(\\mathrm{plim} \\b\\beta = \\b\\beta\\), since \\(\\b\\beta\\) is a constant of true population parameters. Look at the other two terms on the right. They take the form of sample averages \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\). Using the law of of large numbers established in theorem 2.1, we can simplify to:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{plim}\\hat{\\b\\beta} = \\b\\beta + (\\E(\\b{x_i x_i^\\top}))^{-1} \\underbrace{\\E(\\b x_i \\eps_i)}_{=0} = \\b\\beta\n\\]\nAnd we know \\(\\E(\\b x_i \\eps_i) = 0\\) because of the condition of weak exogeneity shown in definition 3.10. Thus, we have proved that OLS is asymptotically consistent.\nNotice how OLS is asymptotically consistent with just weak exogeneity, without requiring full exogeneity. This implies that if we only meet weak exogeneity, our OLS estimates will be biased according to theorem 3.1 (since unbiasedness requires strict exogeneity). However, under only weak exogeneity, our OLS estimates will still be asymptotically consistent despite being biased in finite samples.\nThis means that if we have some reason to believe that we do not meet strict exogeneity, if we meet weak exogeneity, as long as our sample size is sufficiently large, our estimates can still be asymptotically consistent and accurate.",

For example, take this regression:\n\\[\nY_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_t + \\beta_2 X_t^2\n\\]\nThis is still linear in parameters, as no parameters \\(\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) are multiplied together. If we pretend that \\(X_2 = X_1^2\\), then we can write this in the matrix form above.\n\n\n\nThe goal of OLS is to estimate the population parameters in vector \\(\\b\\beta\\).\n\n\nAssumption 2: Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.)\nEach individual in the population \\(t\\)’s \\(Y_t\\) value, \\(y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n\\), must be a result of random variables \\(Y_1, \\dots, Y_n\\) in which all of these random variables are independent of each other (?def-independence), and have the exact same distribution with each other.\n\n\nAssumption 3: No Perfect Multicollinearity\nNo explanatory variables \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) can be perfectly correlated with any other explanatory variable, or perfectly correlated with any linear combination of other explanatory variables. This assumption is required for estimation to be possible with the ordinary least squares estimator, as it requires matrix \\(\\b X\\) to be full rank which allows \\(\\b X^\\top \\b X\\) to be invertable.\n\n\nAssumption 4: Strict Exogeneity\n\nDefinition 3.2 (Strict Exogeneity) This condition is \\(\\E(\\b\\eps | \\b X) = 0\\). This also implies that \\(\\E(\\b X^\\top \\b\\eps) = 0\\), which means all regressors \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) should be uncorrelated with the error terms \\(\\eps\\), and any linear combination of \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) should be uncorrelated with the error term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes on Strict Exogeneity\n\n\n\n\n\nStrict exogeneity is the most violated condition, and when violated, it will bias OLS estimates (as we will see below).\nThe most common reason for why strict exogeneity is violated is when we forget to include an explanatory variable \\(W\\) in our model that is correlated with both some of \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) and \\(Y\\). Thus, the part of \\(W\\) correlated with \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) will also be correlated with the error term \\(\\eps_i\\), since \\(W\\) if not included in our model will be present in the error.\nLater lessons (such as method of moments) will have solutions to deal with when exogeneity is violated.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumption 5: Spherical Errors\nThe spherical errors assumption says that this covariance matrix should take a certain form:\n\nDefinition 3.3 (Spherical Errors) The spherical errors assumption states that the covariance matrix of errors \\(\\eps_t\\) takes the form:\n\\[\n\\V(\\b\\eps|\\b X) = \\sigma^2 \\b I_n = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma^2 & 0 & 0 & \\dots \\\\\n0 & \\sigma^2 & 0 & \\dots  \\\\\n0 & 0& \\sigma^2 & \\vdots \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\dots & \\ddots\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariance-Covariance Matrix of Errors\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variance-covariance matrix of errors \\(\\eps_t\\) takes the form:\n\\[\n\\V(\\b\\eps | \\b X) = \\b\\Omega = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\V \\eps_1 & Cov(\\eps_1, \\eps_2) & Cov(\\eps_1, \\eps_3) & \\dots \\\\\nCov(\\eps_2, \\eps_1) & \\V \\eps_2 & Cov(\\eps_2, \\eps_3) & \\dots \\\\\nCov(\\eps_3, \\eps_1) & Cov(\\eps_3, \\eps_2) & \\V\\eps_3 & \\vdots \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\dots & \\ddots\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\n\nSpherical errors implies two things: No Autocorrelation means that the covariance of any two error terms \\(Cov(\\eps_i, \\eps_j) = 0\\). This is reflected in spherical errors with all the 0’s in the non-diagonal positions. This assumption is generally met if we meet the i.i.d. assumption.\nHomoscedasticity means that every \\(\\eps_t\\) for any observation \\(t\\) has the same variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). The variance of the error \\(\\eps_t\\) does not depend on the values of \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\). If this condition is violated, as in each observation \\(t\\) has their own \\(\\sigma^2_t\\), we call this homoscedasticity.",

    "text": "4.1 Conditional Heteroscedasticity\nFor the classical linear model, one of the assumptions was spherical errors (?def-sphericalerrors). This was an assumption made on the variance-covariance matrix of error term \\(\\eps_t\\). However, this assumption is often violated - in fact, in many fields like econometrics, we assume it is violated by default. What occurs when the other 4 assumptions of the classical model are met, but spherical errors is violated? This chapter explains how we can deal with this scenario.\nSpherical Errors was broken into two parts. No autocorrelation implied that the covariance elements were all equal to 0, and homoscedasticity implied that all the variances were equal to some constant \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nFor the first part of this chapter, we will keep the no autocorrelation assumption, but weaken homoscedasticity. Instead of assuming all observations \\(t\\) have the same error variable \\(\\sigma^2\\), we will now assume that each different observation has different error variances \\(\\sigma^2_t\\).\nThe above is a residual plot of OLS residuals \\(\\hat\\eps_i\\) against some explanatory variable \\(X\\). Notice how for homoscedasticity, the variance of the error terms (how spread out they are up-down wise) is constant for any value of \\(X\\).\nFor heteroscedasticity, we can clearly see that the residual variance is smaller for some \\(X\\) values, and larger for other \\(X\\) values. If you see a pattern in your residual plot, it is likely heteroscedasticity.\nWhen heteroscedasticity is present, that means our spherical errors assumption of the classical linear model is violated. What implications does this have?\nUnder heteroscedasticity, OLS is still unbiased, since by ?thm-olsunbiased, we see that the unbiasedness of OLS does not require spherical errors.\nHowever, OLS now has inaccurate standard error estimates since OLS variance (?thm-varols) used the condition of spherical errors. OLS is also no longer the best linear unbiased estimator (the linear unbiased estimator with the least variance), since the Gauss-Markov Theorem (?thm-gaussmarkov) requires spherical errors.\nIn this chapter, we will introduce two ways to deal with heteroscedasticity.

    "text": "4.2 Robust Standard Errors\nIf conditional heteroscedasticity (definition 4.1) is present in our population model, then the standard OLS variance (?thm-varols) is inaccurate, since that variance calculation used homoscedasticity.\nThus, we need to find the “true” standard errors under homoscedasticity.\n\nTheorem 4.1 (Heteroscedasticity Variance of OLS) The variance of the OLS estimator under heteroscedasticity is given by\n\\[\n\\V(\\hat{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) = (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b X^\\top \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma^2_1 & 0 & 0 & \\dots \\\\\n0 & \\sigma^2_2 & 0 & \\dots  \\\\\n0 & 0& \\sigma^2_3 & \\vdots \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\dots & \\ddots\n\\end{pmatrix} \\b X(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\n\\]\n\n\nProof: Let us start where we left off from ?eq-olsimplify during the proof of unbiasedness. This tells us the variance of the OLS estimator is:\n\\[\n\\V(\\hat{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) = \\V(\\b\\beta + (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1} \\b{X^\\top \\eps})\n\\]\nWe know that \\(\\b\\beta\\) is a vector of fixed true population values. \\((\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1} \\b X^\\top\\) can also be considered a fixed constant matrix because we are conditioning our variance on \\(\\b X\\). Thus, we can use ?thm-variance to rewrite the above as\n\\[\n\\V(\\hat{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) = (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b X^\\top \\V(\\b\\eps| \\b X)[(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b X^\\top]^{-1}\n\\]\nWith the properties of matrix inverses and transposes, we can determine that \\([(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b X^\\top]^{-1}\\) is equivalent to \\(\\b X(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\). Thus, plugging this in, we get\n\\[\n\\V(\\hat{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) = (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b X^\\top \\V(\\b\\eps| \\b X) \\b X(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\n\\]\nNow, by conditional heteroscedasticity (definition 4.1), we can replace \\(\\V(\\b\\eps|\\b X)\\) with the heteroscedasticity variance matrix of errors:\n\\[\n\\V(\\hat{\\b\\beta}|\\b X) = (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b X^\\top \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma^2_1 & 0 & 0 & \\dots \\\\\n0 & \\sigma^2_2 & 0 & \\dots  \\\\\n0 & 0& \\sigma^2_3 & \\vdots \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\dots & \\ddots\n\\end{pmatrix} \\b X(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\n\\]\nAnd thus, we have proven the OLS variance under heteroscedasticity. When we actually write the formula, we will typically replace the matrix with \\(\\b\\Omega\\).\nHowever, we of course do not know what the population values of \\(\\sigma^2_1, \\dots, \\sigma^2_n\\) are. We can estimate them with OLS residuals as follows:\n\\[\n\\sigma_t^2 \\approx s_t^2 = \\eps^2_t\n\\]\nAnd our robust standard errors for any parameter \\(\\hat\\beta_j\\) are simply\n\\[\nse(\\hat\\beta_j) = \\sqrt{[(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b X^\\top \\hat{\\b\\Omega} \\b X(\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}]}_{jj}\n\\]\nWe can conduct statistical inference in the same way as we did for OLS, but replacing the standard errors with our new robust standard errors.",

However, OLS with robust standard errors is no longer the best linear unbiased estimator, as the Gauss-Markov theorem from theorem 3.3 depends on spherical errors.\nThe weighted least squares (WLS) estimator is an alternative of OLS (and is considered a special case of the generalised least squares estimator we will see later in the chapter).\nSuppose that our heteroscedasticity is of the form:\n\\[\n\\V(\\eps_i|\\b X) = \\sigma^2 \\  \\Omega(X_i)\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\nWhere \\(\\sigma^2\\) is some constant (can be 1) and \\(\\Omega(X_i)\\) is some function of \\(X_i\\) that explained the difference in error variance between individuals.\nNow, consider the variance of this (modified) error term that is the original error \\(\\eps_i\\) divided by the square root \\(\\Omega(X_i)\\), which is a function of \\(X_i\\):\n\\[\n\\V \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}}\\eps_i \\biggr| X_i \\right)\n\\]\nUsing theorem 1.2, we know \\(\\V(cu) = c^2 \\V(u)\\) if \\(c\\) is a constant and \\(u\\) is a random variable. This function also applies to a function \\(a(x)\\) where \\(\\V(a(x) u) = a(x)^2 \\V(u)\\). Using this, we can determine the variance of the modified error term is equal to\n\\[\n\\V \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}}\\eps_i \\biggr| X_i \\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}}\\right)^2 \\V(\\eps_i | X_i)\n\\]\nAnd from eq. 4.1, we can plug in \\(\\V(\\eps_i|X_i) = \\sigma^2 \\ \\Omega(X_i)\\) to get\n\\[\n\\V \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}}\\eps_i \\biggr| X_i \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Omega(X_i)}\\sigma^2 \\ \\Omega(X_i) = \\sigma^2\n\\]\nWhat does this tell us? Well it tells us the modified error term \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}} \\eps_i\\) has a variance of constant \\(\\sigma^2\\) for all units \\(i\\), which does not dependent on \\(X_i\\). What does this mean? Well, our modified error term is now meeting homoscedasticity as defined in definition 3.4!\nHowever, we obviously cannot just divide the error term by \\(1/\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}\\) - that changes our linear model. What we can though do is divide every term of our linear model by \\(1/\\sigma_i\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{Y_i}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}} = \\beta_0\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}}\\right) + \\beta_1 \\left(\\frac{X_{i1}}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}}\\right) + \\dots +  \\frac{\\eps_i}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}}\n\\tag{4.2}\\]\nAnd since we divide both side by \\(1/\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}\\), and our model is conditional on individual \\(i\\) (see all the subscripts), that means this model is still “equivalent” to our original linear model.\nThus, the idea of weighted least squares is to “transform” our heteroscedastic linear model into one that meets homoscedasitcity. We can then just use OLS on our new homoscedastic regression, and since homoscedsaticity is met, Gauss-Markov from theorem 3.3 is met, and our estimator is once again the best linear unbiased estimator.",

    "text": "4.5 Autocorrelation\nSo far, we have weakened the spherical errors assumption (?def-sphericalerrors) only through weakening homoscedasticity to heteroscedasticity.\nHowever, the spherical errors assumption also states another assumption - no autocorrelation - i.e. the covariance between two error terms \\(Cov(\\eps_i, \\eps_j) = 0\\). This assumption is typically implied by the i.i.d assumption.\nHowever, there are settings where we cannot assume i.i.d. and no autocorrelation. For example, in time series settings of one variable \\(Y\\) over a set of time periods \\(t\\), we would expect a previous value in time \\(t-1\\) to have some effect on \\(t\\), which implies that values from \\(t-1\\) and \\(t\\) are not independent random variables, and might have some covariance. We will discuss time series in far more detail later in the course.\nSimilarly, in datasets with spatial characteristics, we might expect some neighbouring areas to have correlated errors. For example, if we are modelling \\(Y\\) as unemployment rate, and we have a bunch of \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\), we might be missing out on some regional trends, like a regional natural disaster that is causing some neighbouring counties to have higher than expected unemployment rates \\(Y\\).\nThe presence of autocorrelation means that our error-covariance matrix will not be a diagonal matrix, as some \\(Cov(\\eps_i, \\eps_j) ≠ 0\\):\n\\[\n\\V(\\b\\eps | \\b X) = \\b\\Omega = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\V \\eps_1 & Cov(\\eps_1, \\eps_2) & Cov(\\eps_1, \\eps_3) & \\dots \\\\\nCov(\\eps_2, \\eps_1) & \\V \\eps_2 & Cov(\\eps_2, \\eps_3) & \\dots \\\\\nCov(\\eps_3, \\eps_1) & Cov(\\eps_3, \\eps_2) & \\V\\eps_3 & \\vdots \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\dots & \\ddots\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nJust like with conditional heteroscedasticity, the presence of autocorrelation alone does not cause bias in OLS, since OLS unbiasedness (?thm-olsunbiased) does not depend on spherical errors. However, OLS will no longer be the best-linear unbiased estimator, and (as we will cover more in detail in the time-series chapters later), autocorrelation is often associated with violations of exogeneity (?def-strictexog).\nIf we assume that only autocorrelation is present (and no violation of exogeneity is occurring), then we have two approaches, just like in heteroscedasticity.\nWe could stick with the OLS estimator, but use Autocorrelation and Heteroscedasticity Robust (HAC) standard errors. If we are sampling with clustered sampling, we can use clustered standard errors (see below). I will not derive them here, since these standard errors aren’t too commonly used, and are very difficult to derive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClustered Standard Errors\n\n\n\n\n\nClustered standard errors are when you have done clustered sampling for your observations. For example, you randomly sample 100 people from 100 different villages.\nThe errors of observations belonging to the same cluster (say village) might exhibit correlation, while errors of observtations from distinct clusters are assumed to be uncorrelated.\nOur covariance matrix might take the form:\n\\[\n\\b\\Omega = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\b\\Sigma_1 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\b\\Sigma_2 & & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & 0 & \\ddots & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0& \\dots & \\b\\Sigma_G\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\b\\Sigma_1, \\dots \\b\\Sigma_G\\) are intracluster covariance-variance error matrices, that exhibit autocorrelation. We just insert this matrix where we would insert it for robust standard errors.\n\n\n\nOr, we could use another estimator, such as the Cochrane-Orcutt Estimator or the Generalised Least Squares estimator, which we will introduce later in the chapter.",

    "text": "4.8 Feasible Generalised Least Squares\nWe have derived the generalised least squares (GLS) estimator’s parameter estimates and variance. However, we do not know what \\(\\b\\Omega\\) is, as it is made up of the population variance and covariances of error terms \\(\\eps_i\\). Thus, we need some estimator of \\(\\hat{\\b\\Omega}\\) to actually implement generalised least squares. When combining this estimator of \\(\\hat{\\b\\Omega}\\) with GLS, we call this new estimator the feasible generalised least squares (FGLS) estimator.\nWe have two ways to get a consistent estimator of \\(\\b\\Omega\\). First, if we have some strong idea of the form of heteroscedasticity or autocorrelation in our population (perhaps due to past research or some strong internal reasoning), we could estimate \\(\\b\\Omega\\).\nFor example, if we believe that there is autocorrelation defined by the Autoregerssive first order process from the Cochrane-Orcutt Estimator, then we know the structure of \\(\\b\\Omega\\) is:\n\\[\n\\b\\Omega = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & \\rho & \\rho^2 & \\dots & \\rho^{n-1} \\\\\n\\rho & 1 & \\rho & \\dots & \\rho^{n-2} \\\\\n\\rho^2 & \\rho & 1 & \\dots & \\rho^{n-3} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\rho^{n-1} & \\rho^{n-2} & \\rho^{n-3} & \\dots & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nOther examples of knowing \\(\\b\\Omega\\) include financial data heteroscedasticity being proportional to some known factor like the market capitalisation of a unit, or spatial data where autocorrelation can be modeled as a [decaying] function of distance.\nThe other option (which is far more common) is to estimate \\(\\b\\Omega\\). We typically produce a estimate \\(\\hat{\\b\\Omega}\\) by first running an OLS regression, in which we will obtain the residuals \\(\\hat\\eps_i\\). These can be used to estimate the structure of \\(\\b\\Omega\\), producing \\(\\hat{\\b\\Omega}\\). Then, using this estimate \\(\\hat{\\b\\Omega}\\), we can run feasible GLS, and obtain an estimator with less error.\n\nDefinition 4.4 (Feasible Generalised Least Squares Estimator) The feasible generalised least squares estimator produces estimates\n\\[\n\\hat{\\b\\beta} = (\\b X^\\top \\hat{\\b\\Omega}^{-1} \\b X)^{-1} \\b X^\\top \\hat{\\b\\Omega}^{-1} \\b y\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\hat{\\b\\Omega}\\) is the estimated variance-covariance matrix of the error term \\(\\eps_i\\), frequently through an OLS estimation before conducting feasible generalised least squares. The variance of the estimator is\n\\[\n\\V\\hat{\\b\\beta} = (\\b X^\\top \\hat{\\b\\Omega}^{-1} \\b X)^{-1}\n\\]\n\n\nThe square root of the variance of the FGLS estimator are the standard errors, and we can conduct t-tests just as we did for OLS.\nHowever, when we estimate \\(\\hat{\\b\\Omega}\\) with OLS (or any other method), we of course have some imprecision in our estimates. Econometricians have shown that the feasible GLS estimator often is far worse than the hypothetical perfect GLS. Very often, feasible GLS will actually result in larger variances of estimates.\nThere is also some risk with feasible GLS. Often, heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation occur in our estimated OLS models not because the population actually has heteroscedasticity or autocorrelation, but rather, our original linear model is missing some explanatory variables which causes other violations in our classical linear model, such as exogeneity violations. This mispecified nature will not only make FGLS even more imprecise, but also has the potential to bias FGLS estimates.\nThus, FGLS is not super popular in most applied statistician’s toolkit, and the default tends to be sticking to OLS with either robust standard errors or Heteroscedasticity-and-autocorrelation (HAC) robust standard errors.",

    "text": "4.3 Model Transformation\nWhen heteroscedasticity (definition 4.1) is present, we could just use the OLS estimator with robust standard errors. However, OLS with robust standard errors is no longer the best linear unbiased estimator, as the Gauss-Markov theorem (theorem 3.3) depends on spherical errors.\nThe weighted least squares (WLS) estimator is an alternative of OLS (and is considered a special case of the generalised least squares estimator we will see later in the chapter).\nSuppose that our heteroscedasticity is of the form:\n\\[\n\\V(\\eps_i|\\b X) = \\sigma^2 \\  \\Omega(X_i)\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\nWhere \\(\\sigma^2\\) is some constant (can be 1) and \\(\\Omega(X_i)\\) is some function of \\(X_i\\) that explained the difference in error variance between individuals.\nNow, consider the variance of this (modified) error term that is the original error \\(\\eps_i\\) divided by the square root \\(\\Omega(X_i)\\), which is a function of \\(X_i\\):\n\\[\n\\V \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}}\\eps_i \\biggr| X_i \\right)\n\\]\nUsing theorem 1.2, we know \\(\\V(cu) = c^2 \\V(u)\\) if \\(c\\) is a constant and \\(u\\) is a random variable. This function also applies to a function \\(a(x)\\) where \\(\\V(a(x) u) = a(x)^2 \\V(u)\\). Using this, we can determine the variance of the modified error term is equal to\n\\[\n\\V \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}}\\eps_i \\biggr| X_i \\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}}\\right)^2 \\V(\\eps_i | X_i)\n\\]\nAnd from eq. 4.1, we can plug in \\(\\V(\\eps_i|X_i) = \\sigma^2 \\ \\Omega(X_i)\\) to get\n\\[\n\\V \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}}\\eps_i \\biggr| X_i \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Omega(X_i)}\\sigma^2 \\ \\Omega(X_i) = \\sigma^2\n\\]\nWhat does this tell us? Well it tells us the modified error term \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}} \\eps_i\\) has a variance of constant \\(\\sigma^2\\) for all units \\(i\\), which does not dependent on \\(X_i\\). What does this mean? Well, our modified error term is now meeting homoscedasticity (definition 3.3)!\nHowever, we obviously cannot just divide the error term by \\(1/\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}\\) - that changes our linear model. What we can though do is divide every term of our linear model by \\(1/\\sigma_i\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{Y_i}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}} = \\beta_0\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}}\\right) + \\beta_1 \\left(\\frac{X_{i1}}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}}\\right) + \\dots +  \\frac{\\eps_i}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}}\n\\tag{4.2}\\]\nAnd since we divide both side by \\(1/\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}\\), and our model is conditional on individual \\(i\\) (see all the subscripts), that means this model is still “equivalent” to our original linear model.\nThus, the idea of weighted least squares is to “transform” our heteroscedastic linear model into one that meets homoscedasitcity. We can then just use OLS on our new homoscedastic regression, and since homoscedsaticity is met, Gauss-Markov from theorem 3.3 is met, and our estimator is once again the best linear unbiased estimator.",

    "text": "6.1 Moments and Estimation\nIn our original ordinary least squares estimator, we required 5 conditions: linearity, i.i.d., no perfect multicollinearity, exogeneity, and spherical errors. In the generalised least squares estimator, we dropped the spherical errors condition. In the maximum likelihood estimator, we dropped the spherical errors and linearity condition.\nHowever, all of these estimators require exogeneity. We previously defined exogeneity (?def-strictexog, ?def-weakexog) as explanatory variables being uncorelated with the error term. However, exogeneity can also be described in another way - proper model specification. After all, exogeneity is only met if we properly specify our data generating process to seperate the mean \\(\\mu_Y\\) and variance of error \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nWhat if we cannot meet this proper model specification of the data generating process? An alternative estimator is possible - the method of moments estimator. The method of moments estimator requires very few assumptions about the form of our model. Importantly, we do not even need to know the probability density function of our data generating process.\nThe method of moments focuses on the moments of a distribution. Let us review what moments are. The \\(k\\)th raw moment is defined as\n\\[\n\\mu_k = \\E(X^k)\n\\]\nWhere the first moment \\(\\mu_X^1\\) is the expectation itself. There are also central moments, which are defined as\n\\[\n\\mu_k^1 = \\E((X - \\E X)^k)\n\\]\nThe method of moments equates each \\(k\\) moment with the sample equivalent:\n\\[\n\\mu_k = \\E(X^k) \\ \\approx \\ \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^nx_t^k\n\\]\nSo we equate the first moment \\(\\mu_X^1\\) with the first sample moment, the second moment \\(\\mu_X^2\\) with the second sample moment, and so on.\nWe should have as many moments-sample moment combinations as we have unknown parameters. Once we have our moments, we can solve for our parameters. In the next section, we will go over the simple example of a sample-mean and variance estimator.\nBecause of the law of large numbers (theorem 2.1), method of moments estimators as asymptotically consistent estimators. These estimators are also very simple - we do not require any information about the data generating process besides its moments.",

This will make the number of outcomes grow massively (especially if multiply other units affect an individual).\nCommon causes of SUTVA violations include:\n\nSpill-over effects: If we are testing a new curriculum, one student \\(j\\) getting the new curriculum may teach their friend \\(i\\) the new curriculum, which means if student \\(j\\) got or did not get the new curriculum would affect student \\(i\\)’s outcomes.\nDilution: For example, in vaccines, there is herd immunity. That means other people getting the vaccines also improves my health outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 7.2 (Individual Treatment Effect) The individual treatment effect of treatment \\(D\\) on \\(Y\\), for a specific unit \\(i\\), is given by the difference between the potential outcomes.\n\\[\n\\tau_i = Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 7.3 (Observed Outcomes and Counterfactuals) The observed outcome \\(Y_i\\) that we actually see for a unit \\(i\\) can be given by a function of potential outcomes:\n\\[\nY_i = D_i \\cdot Y_{1i} + (1-D_i) \\cdot Y_{0i}\n\\]\nIf we plug in the treatment status \\(D_i = 0, 1\\) of unit \\(i\\) into the above equation, we get observed outcomes\n\\[\nY_i = \\begin{cases}\nY_{1i} & \\text{if} D_i = 1 \\\\\nY_{0i} & \\text{if} D_i = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe potential outcome that is not observed is the counterfactual outcome.",

    "text": "7.2 Directed Acyclic Graphs\nAn alternative framework of viewing causality is through directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which were pioneered by Pearl. DAGs are a visual way of representing our own beliefs on how different variables are correlated with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a DAG, we have nodes. These represent variables of interest. Then, we have arrows. These show the causal relationships between the variables that we believe are present.\nA path is defined by any possible route between two variables. Paths do not have to follow the direction of errors. For example, in the above figure, we have a path directly between \\(D \\rightarrow Y\\), but also a path \\(D \\leftarrow Z \\leftarrow W \\rightarrow Y\\) and \\(D \\leftarrow Q \\rightarrow Y\\).\nOur goal in causal inference is to isolate the path between \\(D \\rightarrow Y\\), and block any other paths (backdoor paths) between \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\). We can do this in two ways. The first way is to have some external intervention that determines \\(D\\) independent of all the variables in our diagram, represented by a “do” operator:\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause our external operator is determining \\(D\\), that means the causal relationships of \\(Q \\rightarrow D\\) and \\(Z \\rightarrow D\\) are no longer determining the value of \\(D\\). Thus, those arrows are now “broken” or deleted, which deletes the backdoor paths between \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\) through \\(Q\\) and \\(Z\\), leaving only the causal effect \\(D \\rightarrow Y\\).\nA second way to isolate \\(D \\rightarrow Y\\) is through blocking backdoor paths by “conditioning” on a set of nodes \\(\\mathcal X\\) (discussed more later). A set of nodes \\(\\mathcal X\\) blocks a path if 1 of 2 is true:\n\nIf the path in question has at least one arrow-emitting node that is included in the set \\(\\mathcal X\\), then that path is blocked.\nIf the path itself includes one collision node where multiple arrows point into it, and this collision node is not included in \\(\\mathcal X\\), then this path is blocked.\n\nIf we block all backdoor paths by conditioning on a set of nodes \\(\\mathcal X\\), then we can isolate \\(D \\rightarrow Y\\), our causal effect.",

    "text": "7.4 Selection Bias\nYou always here the saying - correlation is not causation. But what does that actually mean? A simple model of correlation \\(\\rho\\) is finding how observed \\(Y\\) changes when \\(D\\) changes. More specifically, we want to find the differences in conditional expectations (given by definition 1.5) of observed \\(Y_i\\) values for when \\(D_i = 1\\) and \\(D_i = 0\\):\n\\[\n\\rho_{D, Y} = \\E(Y_i|D_i = 1) - \\E (Y_i | D_i = 0)\n\\]Now, let us do some algebra. First, we know that \\(Y_i|D_i = 1\\) is the observed potential outcome \\(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1\\). We also know that \\(Y_i|D_i = 0\\) is the observed potential outcome \\(Y_{0i}|D_I = 0\\). Thus, we can rewrite the above to\n\\[\n\\rho_{D, Y} = \\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1) - \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0)\n\\]\nNow, let us do an algebra trick. We know that adding a zero doesn’t change the equality of the equation. Let us add the term \\(\\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 1)\\), but then also subtract that term, so we are essentially adding a 0. Then we get\n\\[\n\\rho_{D, Y} = \\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1) - \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0) \\color{blue}{+ \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 1)}\\color{purple}{ - \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 1)}\n\\]\nLet us rearrange the order of the terms to get\n\\[\n\\rho_{D, Y} = \\underbrace{\\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1) \\color{purple}{ - \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 1)}}_{\\tau_{ATT}} \\underbrace{\\color{blue}{+ \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 1)} \\color{black}- \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0)}_{\\text{selection bias}}\n\\tag{7.1}\\]\nWe can see that according to definition 7.5, the first part of this correlation between \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\) is the ATT, one of the causal estimands. However, the correlation \\(\\rho_{D,Y}\\) does not only equal the \\(\\tau_{ATT}\\), as there is an extra bit, the selection bias. If this selection bias is not 0, then our correlation is clearly not equal to our ATT.\nLet us look at the selection bias term more carefully:\n\\[\n\\underbrace{\\color{blue}{+ \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 1)} \\color{black}- \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0)}_{\\text{selection bias}}\n\\]\nThe blue part is the average potential outcome under parallel world \\(D_i = 0\\) for the units that were assigned to treatment \\(D_i = 1\\). The black part is the average potential outcome under parallel world \\(D_i = 0\\) for units that were assigned to control \\(D_i = 0\\).\nIf this term is non-zero, that means the control group and treatment group have different average \\(Y_{0i}\\) values. That means, before our experiment had even started, the control and treatment groups had different baseline potential outcome \\(Y_{0i}\\). If for example, the treatment group \\(D_i = 1\\) initially had a very low \\(Y_{0i}\\), even after treatment with true effect \\(+\\tau\\), their outcome \\(Y_i\\) may still be lower than people who didn’t get the treatment.

    "text": "7.6 Randomisation\nOne way we can eliminate selection bias is through randomly assigning our subjects to either treatment \\(D_i = 1\\) or control \\(D_i = 0\\). Since we are determining (through randomisation) who gets \\(D\\), that means confounder \\(X\\) is no longer determining who gets \\(D\\). This breaks the relationship between \\(X \\rightarrow D\\), eliminating the backdoor path and selection bias.\nRandomisation implies that the assignment probabilities do not depend on the potential outcomes - the values of \\(Y_{0i}\\) and \\(Y_{1i}\\) do not affect the probability of a unit \\(i\\) getting put into treatment \\(D_i = 1\\) or control \\(D_i = 0\\).\n\\[\n\\P(D_i = 1 | Y_{0i}, Y_{1i}) \\ = \\ \\P(D_i = 1)\n\\]\nThis fact implies the critical assumption of randomisation, independence.\n\nDefinition 7.8 (Independence) Randomisation, if done properly, implies independence. Independence, also called unconfoundedness or ignorability, is the statement that potential outcomes are independent of treatment:\n\\[\n(Y_{1i}, Y_{0i}) \\ind D_i\n\\]\nThis assumption, and the defintition of independence from definition 1.4, implies that \\(\\E Y_{0i}\\) and \\(\\E Y_{1i}\\) are equal between treatment and control:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 1) \\ = \\ \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0) \\ = \\ \\E Y_{0i} \\\\\n& \\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1) \\ = \\ \\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 0) \\ = \\ \\E Y_{1i}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking if Independence is Met\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we are writing a paper, we might want to convince our readers that randomisation has indeed successfully been implemented, and that the assumption of independence has been met. The most common way to check this is with a balance check. We essentially consider a few likely confounders \\(X\\). We then run a regression:\n\\[\nX_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 D_i + \\eps_i\n\\]\n\\(\\beta_1\\) will show the difference between \\(\\E(X_i | D_i = 1)\\) and \\(\\E(X_i|D_i = 0)\\). If \\(\\beta_1\\) is not statistically significantly different, then we can conclude the treatment and control groups are similar, and that randomisation has suceeded.\nDo note that the important thing in randomisation (and the assumption of independence) is not that \\(X_i\\) is random between treatment and control, but rather potential outcomes are random. Although, if \\(X_i\\) is random between treatment and control, that generally implies potential outcomes are also random.\n\n\n\nWe can prove that randomisation and the independence assumption allow us to eliminate the selection bias shown in eq. 7.1. Let us start with our correlation from eq. 7.1:\n\\[\n\\rho_{D, Y} = \\underbrace{\\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1)- \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 1)}_{\\tau_{ATT}} + \\underbrace{\\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 1) - \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0)}_{\\text{selection bias}}\n\\]\nUsing the properties of independence from definition 7.8, we can get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_{D, Y} & = \\underbrace{\\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1)- \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 1)}_{\\tau_{ATT}} + \\underbrace{\\E Y_{0i} - \\E Y_{0i}}_{\\text{selection bias}} \\\\\n& = \\underbrace{\\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1)- \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 1)}_{\\tau_{ATT}} + 0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThus, we can see the assumption of independence has removed our selection bias, and allowed us to accurately calculate our \\(\\tau_{ATT}\\) simply by looking at the correlation \\(\\rho_{D,Y}\\).\nWe can also identify the ATE from our correlation \\(\\rho_{D,Y}\\), by simplifying once again using the properties implied by the assumption of independence from definition 7.8:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_{D, Y} & = \\underbrace{\\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1)- \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 1)}_{\\tau_{ATT}} \\\\\n& = \\underbrace{\\E Y_{1i} - \\E Y_{0i}}_{\\tau_{ATE}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWhich according to definition 7.4, is the ATE. Thus, under randomisation, our correlation measure \\(\\rho_{D,Y}\\) properly identifies/measures both the ATT and ATE, and the ATT and ATE are equivalent under randomisation. Thus, we can estimate the ATE in a randomisation setting where independence is met simply with a correlation measure, such as a linear model:\n\\[\nY_i = \\alpha + \\tau D_i + \\eps_i\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\tau\\) can be estimated with OLS, GLS, or MLE (although OLS with robust standard errors is generally the preferred estimator).",

    "text": "7.5 Selection on Observables\nRandomisation is not always feasible. Selection on Observables is an alternative way to get rid of the selection bias problem by controlling for a set of confounders \\(\\mathcal X\\) to isolate the relationship between \\(D \\rightarrow Y\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above figure, there is one confounder \\(X\\), since \\(X\\) is causing \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\). Thus, we will include \\(X\\) in our set of confounders \\(\\mathcal X = \\{X\\}\\). The set \\(\\mathcal X\\) can include as many confounders as needed. \\(V\\) is not a confounder because it is post-treatment caused by \\(D\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood and Bad Controls\n\n\n\n\n\nGood controls are confounders \\(X\\) who cause \\(D\\) (i.e. \\(X \\rightarrow D\\)), and cause/caused by \\(Y\\). They must be linked to both \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\).\nBad controls are any variable \\(W\\) that is caused by \\(D\\), i.e. \\(D \\rightarrow W\\). We do not need to control for this because \\(W\\) isn’t causing selection into \\(D\\), it is actually itself caused by \\(D\\).\nAnother bad control is a variable \\(Z\\) that only causes \\(D\\), and not \\(Y\\). This reduces the variation in \\(D\\) (since we are now only using the part of \\(D\\) caused by \\(Y\\)), which may amplify any other confounders unaccounted for.\nNeutral controls are variables that only cause \\(Y\\) and are not associated with \\(D\\). They do not affect the causal identification, but can reduce our standard errors of our estimates.\n\n\n\nWe will have controlled for the correct amount of confounders in set \\(\\mathcal X\\), when we have eliminated all variables causing selection bias, and we meet the following assumptions:\n\nDefinition 7.9 (Selection on Observables) There are 2 assumptions needed to identify causal effects in the selections on observables framework.\nConditional Ignorability (also called conditional independence) means that among units \\(i\\) with identical confounder values \\(\\mathcal X_i\\), treatment \\(D_i\\) is as-if randomly assigned. Potential outcomes are independent from treatment within each specific confounder value \\(\\mathcal X_i = x\\).\n\\[\n(Y_{0i}, Y_{1i}) \\ind D_i \\ | \\ \\mathcal X_i = x, \\ \\forall \\ x \\in \\mathcal X\n\\]\nThis assumption implies that given any value of confounders \\(\\mathcal X_i = x\\), potential outcomes are equivalent between treatment and control groups:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) \\ = \\ \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x) \\ = \\ \\E(Y_{0i}|\\mathcal X_i = x) \\\\\n& \\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) \\ = \\ \\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x) \\ = \\ \\E(Y_{1i}|\\mathcal X_i = x)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nCommon Support is the second assumption, and it states for any unit \\(i\\) with any value of \\(\\mathcal X_i\\), they have a non-zero probability they can be assigned to both control and treatment.\n\nHow do these assumptions help us identify and measure the causal effect? Well, let us first start with the CATE from definition 7.6:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau_{CATE}(x) & = \\E(Y_{1i} - Y_{0i} \\ | \\ \\mathcal X_i = x) \\\\\n& = \\E(Y_{1i} | \\mathcal X_i = x) - \\E(Y_{0i}|\\mathcal X_i = x) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, from the properties implied by conditional ignorability given in definition 7.9, we get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau_{CATE}(x) & = \\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) - \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x) \\\\\n& = \\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) - \\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{7.2}\\]\nAnd the second step above is because \\(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1\\) and \\(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0\\) are observable outcomes. Thus, with independence, we can identify the CATE with just observed outcomes.\nNow, let us consider the ATE, which is \\(\\E(Y_{1i} - Y_{0i})\\). From the definition of a continuous random variable’s expectation given in definition 1.2, we can rewrite the ATE as\n\\[\n\\tau_{ATE} = \\int\\tau_{CATE}(x) \\P(\\mathcal x) dy\n\\]\nWhich is a weighted average. We established in eq. 7.2 that we can identify the CATE. Thus, we can plug eq. 7.2 into the ATE to get our identified ATE:\n\\[\n\\tau_{ATE} = \\int [\\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) - \\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x)] \\P(x) dy\n\\]\nAnd all the values in this equation are observed outcomes \\(Y_i\\), meaning if we control for set of confounders \\(\\mathcal X\\), our correlation becomes a causal effect.\nWe can also do a very similar proof for identifying the ATT. The conditional-ATT is equal to the CATE based on the assumption of conditional ignorability. Using the definition of the ATT from definition 7.5 and the definition of expectation given in definition 1.2, we see the ATT equals:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau_{ATT} & = \\int \\tau_{CATE}(x) \\P(x|D_i = 1) dy \\\\\n& = \\int [\\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) - \\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x)] \\P(x|D_i = 1) dy\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAnd all the \\(Y_i\\) here are observed, meaning we can identify the ATT.\nAssuming we meet the assumptions given in definition 7.9, there are multiple estimators, including regression, matching, and weighting, which we will discuss in more detail in the chapter on causal estimation.",

However, because of the fundamental problem of causal inference, we do not know the counterfactuals.\nAt an individual level, these counterfactuals are almost impossible to estimate, so we typically do not use the individual treatment effect. Instead, we will typically look at the averages of treatment effects. The most common causal estimand (true value in the population) we will use is the average treatment effect.\n\nDefinition 7.4 (Average Treatment Effect) The ATE is the average individual treatment effects \\(\\tau_i\\) in the population.\n\\[\n\\tau_{ATE} = \\E(\\tau_i) \\  = \\  \\E(Y_{1i} - Y_{0i})  \\ = \\  \\E Y_{1i} - \\E Y_{0i}\n\\]\n\n\nObviously, we do not observe the counterfactual outcomes. However, at a group level, their averages are more easily estimated, which we will explore later in the chapter.\nThe ATE is not the only causal estimand. We will often consider a few other causal estimands.\n\nDefinition 7.5 (Average Treatment Effect on the Treated) The ATT is the average individual treatment effect \\(\\tau_i\\) for only units that were assigned to the treatment group \\(D_i = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\tau_{ATT} = \\E(\\tau_i | D_i = 1) \\ = \\ \\E(Y_{1i} - Y_{0i} | D_i = 1)\n\\]\n\n\nThe ATT is usually not equal to the ATE, but in specific circumstances, they can be equal.\nThe opposite estimand also exists - the average treatment effect on the untreated (ATU). This is typically not something we calculate, but it is used in some proofs.\nSometimes, we also might believe there are heterogenous treatment effects - i.e. some third variable strengthens or weakens the strength of an estimand. For example, perhaps a policy has more positive effects on females than males. Thus, we can also find the ATE conditional on some third variable.\n\nDefinition 7.6 (Conditional Average Treatment Effect) The CATE is the average treatment effect, conditional on some other characteristic/covariate \\(X\\) value:\n\\[\n\\tau_{CATE}(x) = \\E(\\tau_i| X = x) \\ = \\ \\E(Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}|X=x)\n\\]\nThis estimand is also sometimes called the local average treatment effect (LATE).\n\n\nThese causal estimands are all estimands - true population parameters.

For the OLS estimator, we are interested in the central moment of \\(Y\\):\n\\[\n\\mu_1' = \\E(Y - \\E(Y|X)) = \\E( \\b y - \\b{X\\beta} \\ | \\ \\b X) = \\E (\\b\\eps | \\b X)\n\\]\nAnd since we know from eq. 6.1 that \\(\\b\\eps\\) by assumption has a expectation of 0, we get:\n\\[\n\\mu_1' = \\E(\\b\\eps | \\b X) = 0\n\\]\nHowever, there is an issue with this condition - this will only produce one equation to solve, when we have \\(p\\) parameters that need to be estimated for OLS. The solution to this is to multiply the central moment condition by \\(\\b X\\):\n\\[\n\\b X^\\top \\underbrace{\\E(\\b\\eps | \\b X)}_{= \\ 0} = 0\n\\]\nAnd this statement is still true since anything multiplied to 0 equals 0. Now, using the properties of exepctations, we can include \\(\\b X\\) within the expectation since it is a constant considering our expectation conditions of \\(\\b X\\):\n\\[\n\\E( \\b X^\\top \\b \\eps | \\b X) = 0\n\\]\nAnd using the law of iterated expectations (theorem 1.3), we know\n\\[\n\\E(\\b{X^\\top \\eps}) = \\E[\\E( \\b X^\\top \\b \\eps | \\b X)] = \\E[0] = 0\n\\]\nThus, we have our moment condition of OLS.\n\nDefinition 6.1 (OLS Moment Condition) The moment conditions of the ordinary least squares estimator is:\n\\[\n\\E(\\b X^\\top \\eps) = 0\n\\]\n\n\nNotice anything about this moment condition? It is exactly in the same form as our definition of exogeneity (definition 3.2). This is another reason why exogeneity is an important condition in OLS - when violated, our moment condition is invalid.\nTo actually estimate OLS coefficients \\(\\hat{\\b\\beta}\\) with method of moments, we use our sample equivalents:\n\\[\n\\E(\\b X^\\top \\b\\eps) \\approx \\b X^\\top \\hat{\\b\\eps} = 0\n\\]\nWhere we can rewrite as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\b X^\\top (\\b y - \\hat{\\b y}) & = 0 \\\\\n\\b X^\\top(\\b y - \\b X \\hat{\\b\\beta}) & = 0 \\\\\n\\b{X^\\top y} - \\b{X^\\top X \\hat\\beta} & = 0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAnd we can see, is equivalent to the OLS first order conditions (without a factor of 2, but that does not matter since 2 times 0 equals 0).

We can rewrite our matrices in the form of vectors, scalars, and summation, just as we did in the proof of OLS consistency (theorem 3.5). We thus get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\b\\beta}^* & = \\b\\beta + (\\b{Z^\\top X})^{-1} \\b{Z^\\top\\eps} \\\\\n& = \\b\\beta + \\left(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\b z_i \\b x_i^\\top \\right)^{-1} \\left(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\b z_i \\eps_i \\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, let us do a little algebra trick as follows:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\b\\beta}^* = \\b\\beta + \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\b z_i \\b x_i^\\top \\right)^{-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\b z_i \\eps_i \\right)\n\\]\nThe reason we can do this is because the first \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) is inversed as \\(\\frac{1}{n}^{-1}\\), so this cancels out the second one, maintaining the equality of our equation.\nNow, we want to prove \\(\\mathrm{plim}\\hat{\\b\\beta}^* = \\b\\beta\\), so let us take the probability limit of both sides:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{plim}\\hat{\\b\\beta}^* = \\mathrm{plim}\\b\\beta + \\left(\\mathrm{plim}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\b z_i \\b x_i^\\top \\right)^{-1} \\left(\\mathrm{plim}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\b z_i \\eps_i \\right)\n\\]\nWe know the probability limit of a constant is itself. Look at the other two terms on the right: they take the form of sample averages \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\). Using the law of large numbers (theorem 2.1), we can simplify to:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{plim}\\hat{\\b\\beta}^*  = \\b\\beta + (\\E(\\b z_i \\b x_i^\\top))^{-1} \\underbrace{\\E(\\b z_i \\eps_i)}_{= \\ 0} = \\b\\beta\n\\]\nAnd we know \\(\\E(\\b z_i \\eps_i) = 0\\) because this is the same condition as the moment condition \\(\\E(\\b{Z^\\top \\eps}) = 0\\), just written in terms of individual observations.

    "text": "6.7 Two Stage Least Squares\nWhile sometimes we do compute the instrumental variables estimator as shown in definition 6.3, often, we use another estimator, the two-stage-least-squares (2SLS) estimator.\nThe 2SLS estimator is based on the intuitive interpretation of instrumental variables: that we use only the part of \\(X\\) explained by \\(Z\\) (which should be endogenous), and estimate that part of \\(X\\)’s relationship with \\(Y\\).\nThe two stage least squares estimator follows this exact procedure. In the first stage, we find the part of \\(X\\) that is explained by \\(Z\\), which we call \\(\\hat X_t\\):\n\\[\n\\hat X_t = \\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1 Z_t\n\\]\nWe do this by running a linear OLS model with \\(X_t\\) as the outcome variable, and \\(Z_t\\) as the explanatory variable. Our predicted \\(\\hat X_t\\) will be the part of \\(X\\) explained by instrument \\(Z\\).\nThen, for the second stange, we take this \\(\\hat X_t\\), and use it in a model with \\(Y\\) as follows:\n\\[\nY_t = \\delta_0 + \\delta_1 \\hat X_t + \\eps_t\n\\]\nHow is 2SLS in these two stages equal to instrumental variables estimator we derived in definition 6.3?

Thus, we have shown 2SLS is equivalent to the instrumental variables estimator.\nThe main advantage of 2SLS is that we can include control variables in both stages. For example, recall this figure we saw previously:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to uncover the effect of \\(D\\) on \\(Y\\). Imagine that we only have one of the violations above, the one notated ignorability violation (i). In this case, \\(Z\\) is not exogenous to \\(Y\\), because \\(Z\\) and \\(Y\\) are correlated with the confounder \\(M\\) which is in the error term, meaning \\(Z\\) is correlated with the error term.\nHowever, if we included \\(M\\) in our model for both stages, then \\(Z\\) would be exogenous, since \\(M\\) would be a part of our model and not the error term \\(\\eps\\) anymore.",

This is essentially the affect of encouragement. If there is any non-compliance, then the ITT will not equal the ATE.\n\\[\n\\tau_{ITT} = \\E(Y_i|Z_i = 1) - \\E(Y_i | Z_i = 0)\n\\tag{7.3}\\]\nThis is quite easily estimatable in randomisation settings, with a linear model with \\(Y\\) as the outcome and \\(Z\\) as the only explanatory variable.\nHowever, we might not care about the ITT. We might want the actual effect of \\(D\\) on \\(Y\\). An alternative is to find the Average Treatment Effect on only compliers, called the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) (a version of the CATE from definition 7.6). We need a few assumptions:\n\nDefinition 7.10 (Instrument and Non-Compliance Assumptions) There are 4 assumptions for us to identify the LATE. The first 3 are the normal assumptions from the IV estimator.\n\nRelevance: \\(Z\\) must be correlated to \\(D\\). Or in other words, compilers must exist, or else, encouragement would not affect treatment.\nIgnorability/Exogneity: There is no backdoor path between \\(Z\\) and \\(D\\), and no backdoor path between \\(Z\\) and \\(Y\\) (we can do controls/selection on observables to account for this).\nExclusions Restriction: \\(Z\\) must only have an effect on \\(Y\\) through \\(D\\). \\(Z\\) must not have any independent effect on \\(Y\\).\nMonotonicity: There are no defiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Examples of Violations\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure below contains some visual examples of violations of the above to faciliate understanding of these assumptions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us show how we can prove the LATE is identifiable under these assumptions. First, the ITT itself in eq. 9.1 is identifiable under exogeneity/ignorability alone. Now, let us define \\(c\\) as compliers, \\(a\\) as always-takers, \\(n\\) as never-takers, and \\(d\\) as defiers. We can break down the ITT into a weighted average:\n\\[\n\\tau_{ITT} = \\tau_{ITT}^c \\P(c) + \\tau_{ITT}^a \\P(a) + \\tau_{ITT}^n \\P(n) + \\tau_{ITT}^d \\P(d)\n\\]\nWe know that under our assumption of monotonicity, we assume no defiers, so \\(\\P(d) = 0\\):\n\\[\n\\tau_{ITT} = \\tau_{ITT}^c \\P(c) + \\tau_{ITT}^a \\P(a) + \\tau_{ITT}^n \\P(n)\n\\]\nOur exclusions restriction says that \\(Z\\) has no affect on \\(Y\\). Remember that the ITT from eq. 9.1 is the relationship between \\(Z\\) and \\(Y\\). But since always-takers and never-takers ignore \\(Z\\) when deciding treatment, \\(Z\\) has no effect of them on \\(Y\\). Thus, we can further simplify:\n\\[\n\\tau_{ITT} = \\tau_{ITT}^c \\P(c)\n\\]\nRemember that the \\(\\tau_{ITT}\\) for compliers, \\(\\tau_{ITT}^c\\), is our LATE that we want to identify. So, let us isolate it to get:\n\\[\n\\tau_{LATE} = \\frac{\\tau_{ITT}}{\\P(c)} \\ = \\ \\frac{\\E(Y_i | Z_i = 1) - \\E(Y_i | Z_i = 0)}{\\E(D_i | Z_i = 1) - \\E(D_i | Z_i = 0)}\n\\]\nThe LATE is interpreted as the ATE of the compliers. To estimate the LATE, we typically use the two stage least squares estimator, whose theory was covered briefly in the last chapter, and will be covered in an applied perspective later in the chapter on causal designs.",

    "text": "9.2 Identification\nOne causal estimand that we can use is the IV-non-compliance design is the Intent To Treat (ITT), which is essentially the ATE of \\(Z\\) on \\(Y\\), ignoring if people actually took the treatment or not. This is essentially the affect of encouragement. If there is any non-compliance, then the ITT will not equal the ATE.\n\\[\n\\tau_{ITT} = \\E(Y_i|Z_i = 1) - \\E(Y_i | Z_i = 0)\n\\tag{9.1}\\]\nThis is quite easily estimatable in non-compliance randomisation settings, since \\(Z\\) is randomly assigned. Thus, we can calculate the ITT with a linear regression:\n\\[\nY_i = \\alpha + \\tau_{ITT} Z_i + \\eps_i\n\\]\nHowever, we might not care about the ITT. We might want the actual effect of \\(D\\) on \\(Y\\). An alternative is to find the Average Treatment Effect on only compliers, called the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) (a version of the CATE from definition 7.6). We need a few assumptions:\n\nDefinition 9.1 (Instrumental Variables Assumptions) There are 4 assumptions for us to identify the LATE. The first 3 are the normal assumptions from the IV estimator.\n\nRelevance: \\(Z\\) must be correlated to \\(D\\). Or in other words, compilers must exist, or else, encouragement would not affect treatment.\nIgnorability/Exogneity: There is no backdoor path between \\(Z\\) and \\(D\\), and no backdoor path between \\(Z\\) and \\(Y\\) (we can do controls/selection on observables to account for this).\nExclusions Restriction: \\(Z\\) must only have an effect on \\(Y\\) through \\(D\\). \\(Z\\) must not have any independent effect on \\(Y\\).\nMonotonicity: There are no defiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Examples of Violations\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure below contains some visual examples of violations of the above to faciliate understanding of these assumptions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us show how we can prove the LATE is identifiable under these assumptions. First, the ITT itself in eq. 9.1 is identifiable under exogeneity/ignorability alone. Now, let us define \\(c\\) as compliers, \\(a\\) as always-takers, \\(n\\) as never-takers, and \\(d\\) as defiers. We can break down the ITT into a weighted average:\n\\[\n\\tau_{ITT} = \\tau_{ITT}^c \\P(c) + \\tau_{ITT}^a \\P(a) + \\tau_{ITT}^n \\P(n) + \\tau_{ITT}^d \\P(d)\n\\]\nWe know that under our assumption of monotonicity, we assume no defiers, so \\(\\P(d) = 0\\):\n\\[\n\\tau_{ITT} = \\tau_{ITT}^c \\P(c) + \\tau_{ITT}^a \\P(a) + \\tau_{ITT}^n \\P(n)\n\\]\nOur exclusions restriction says that \\(Z\\) has no affect on \\(Y\\). Remember that the ITT from eq. 9.1 is the relationship between \\(Z\\) and \\(Y\\). But since always-takers and never-takers ignore \\(Z\\) when deciding treatment, \\(Z\\) has no effect of them on \\(Y\\). Thus, we can further simplify:\n\\[\n\\tau_{ITT} = \\tau_{ITT}^c \\P(c)\n\\]\nRemember that the \\(\\tau_{ITT}\\) for compliers, \\(\\tau_{ITT}^c\\), is our LATE that we want to identify. So, let us isolate it to get:\n\\[\n\\tau_{LATE} = \\frac{\\tau_{ITT}}{\\P(c)} \\ = \\ \\frac{\\E(Y_i | Z_i = 1) - \\E(Y_i | Z_i = 0)}{\\E(D_i | Z_i = 1) - \\E(D_i | Z_i = 0)}\n\\tag{9.2}\\]\nThe LATE is interpreted as the ATE of the compliers. This can be tricky to interpret sometimes, as you cannot actually identify who the compliers are, and different encouragements \\(Z\\) can result in different compliers.\nThe LATE is also generally not equal to the ATE or ATT without further assumptions. When there is only one-sided non-compliance when people who are not encouraged cannot get the treatment, the LATE does equal the ATT.",

    "text": "8.2 Identification\nWe will have controlled for the correct amount of confounders in set \\(\\mathcal X\\), when we have eliminated all variables causing selection bias, and we meet the following assumptions:\n\nDefinition 8.1 (Selection on Observables) There are 2 assumptions needed to identify causal effects in the selections on observables framework.\nConditional Ignorability (also called conditional independence) means that among units \\(i\\) with identical confounder values \\(\\mathcal X_i\\), treatment \\(D_i\\) is as-if randomly assigned. Potential outcomes are independent from treatment within each specific confounder value \\(\\mathcal X_i = x\\).\n\\[\n(Y_{0i}, Y_{1i}) \\ind D_i \\ | \\ \\mathcal X_i = x, \\ \\forall \\ x \\in \\mathcal X\n\\]\nThis assumption implies that given any value of confounders \\(\\mathcal X_i = x\\), potential outcomes are equivalent between treatment and control groups:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) \\ = \\ \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x) \\ = \\ \\E(Y_{0i}|\\mathcal X_i = x) \\\\\n& \\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) \\ = \\ \\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x) \\ = \\ \\E(Y_{1i}|\\mathcal X_i = x)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nCommon Support is the second assumption, and it states for any unit \\(i\\) with any value of \\(\\mathcal X_i\\), they have a non-zero probability they can be assigned to both control and treatment.\n\nHow do these assumptions help us identify and measure the causal effect? Well, let us first start with the CATE from definition 7.6:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau_{CATE}(x) & = \\E(Y_{1i} - Y_{0i} \\ | \\ \\mathcal X_i = x) \\\\\n& = \\E(Y_{1i} | \\mathcal X_i = x) - \\E(Y_{0i}|\\mathcal X_i = x) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, from the properties implied by conditional ignorability given in definition 8.1, we get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau_{CATE}(x) & = \\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) - \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x) \\\\\n& = \\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) - \\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{8.1}\\]\nAnd the second step above is because \\(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1\\) and \\(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0\\) are observable outcomes. Thus, with independence, we can identify the CATE with just observed outcomes.\nNow, let us consider the ATE, which is \\(\\E(Y_{1i} - Y_{0i})\\). From the definition of a continuous random variable’s expectation given in definition 1.2, we can rewrite the ATE as\n\\[\n\\tau_{ATE} = \\int\\tau_{CATE}(x) \\P(\\mathcal x) dy\n\\]\nWhich is a weighted average. We established in eq. 8.1 that we can identify the CATE. Thus, we can plug eq. 8.1 into the ATE to get our identified ATE:\n\\[\n\\tau_{ATE} = \\int [\\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) - \\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x)] \\P(x) dy\n\\]\nAnd all the values in this equation are observed outcomes \\(Y_i\\), meaning if we control for set of confounders \\(\\mathcal X\\), our correlation becomes a causal effect.\nWe can also do a very similar proof for identifying the ATT. The conditional-ATT is equal to the CATE based on the assumption of conditional ignorability. Using the definition of the ATT from definition 7.5 and the definition of expectation given in definition 1.2, we see the ATT equals:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau_{ATT} & = \\int \\tau_{CATE}(x) \\P(x|D_i = 1) dy \\\\\n& = \\int [\\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) - \\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x)] \\P(x|D_i = 1) dy\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAnd all the \\(Y_i\\) here are observed, meaning we can identify the ATT.\nAssuming we meet the assumptions given in definition 8.1, there are multiple estimators, including regression, matching, and weighting, which we will discuss in more detail in the chapter on causal estimation.",

An \\(X\\) that causes selection bias is called a confounder.\n\nDefinition 7.7 (Confounder) A confounder is a third variable \\(X\\) that causes selection into treatment \\(D\\) and causes changes in outcome \\(Y\\). If there is such a variable, this creates selection bias, and makes correlation not equal causation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the figure above, \\(X\\) is confounding the relationship between \\(D \\rightarrow Y\\). This is because both \\(X\\) is correlated with \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\). When we naively estimated the correlation \\(\\rho_{D,Y}\\), we are estimating the relationship between \\(D \\rightarrow Y\\) and the relationship \\(D \\leftarrow X \\rightarrow Y\\) . But, the true causal effect is \\(D \\rightarrow Y\\), without the other backdoor path. For accurate causal estimation, we need some way to “block” the path through \\(X\\).\nWhy isn’t \\(V\\) a confounder?

    "text": "3.8 Asymptotic Consistency\nBefore we introduce asymptotic properties of the OLS estimator, we have to introduce a new assumption: Weak exogeneity. Previously, we discussed strict exogeneity (definition 3.2). Weak exgoeneity is a weaker version of this assumption.\n\nDefinition 3.10 (Weak Exogeneity) Weak exogeneity is defined as \\(\\E(\\b x_t \\eps_t) = 0\\). Weak exogeneity only requires that regressors \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) individually are uncorrelated with the error term. Weak exogeneity allows for combinations of \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\) to to be correlated with \\(\\eps\\), which is not allowed under strict exogeneity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between Weak and Strict Exogeneity\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you meet strict exogeneity, you automatically meet the assumption of weak exogeneity. However, the opposite is not true - weak exogeneity does not imply strict exogeneity.\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 3.5 (Consistency of OLS) The Ordinary Least Squares estimator is asymptotically consistent (definition 2.6), under the assumptions of linearity, i.i.d., no perfect multicollinearity, weak exogeneity, and spherical errors.\nMathematically, this means\n\\[\n\\mathrm{plim}\\hat{\\b\\beta} = \\b\\beta\n\\]\n\n\nProof: Let us perform the same steps as in eq. 3.4, and start off where we left off. We can rewrite our matrix notation in the form of vectors, scalars, and summation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\b\\beta} & = \\b\\beta + (\\b{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\b{X^\\top\\eps} \\\\\n& = \\b\\beta + \\left(\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n \\b x_t \\b x_t^\\top\\right)^{-1} \\left(\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n\\b x_t \\eps_t \\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, let us do a little algebra trick as follows:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\b\\beta} = \\b\\beta + \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n \\b x_t \\b x_t^\\top\\right)^{-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n\\b x_t \\eps_t \\right)\n\\]\nThe reason we can do this is because the first \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) is inversed as \\(\\frac{1}{n}^{-1}\\), so this cancels out the second one, maintaining the equality of our equation.\nNow, we want to prove \\(\\mathrm{plim}\\hat{\\b\\beta} =\\b\\beta\\), so let us take the probability limit of both sides.\n\\[\n\\mathrm{plim}\\hat{\\b\\beta} = \\mathrm{plim} \\b\\beta + \\left( \\mathrm{plim} \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n \\b x_t \\b x_t^\\top \\right)^{-1} \\left( \\mathrm{plim}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n\\b x_t \\eps_t \\right)\n\\]\nWe know that the probability limit of a constant is itself, so \\(\\mathrm{plim} \\b\\beta = \\b\\beta\\), since \\(\\b\\beta\\) is a constant of true population parameters. Look at the other two terms on the right. They take the form of sample averages \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\). Using the law of of large numbers (theorem 2.1), we can simplify to:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{plim}\\hat{\\b\\beta} = \\b\\beta + (\\E(\\b x_t \\b x_t^\\top))^{-1} \\underbrace{\\E(\\b x_t \\eps_t)}_{=0} = \\b\\beta\n\\]\nAnd we know \\(\\E(\\b x_t \\eps_t) = 0\\) because of the condition of weak exogeneity (definition 3.10). Thus, we have proved that OLS is asymptotically consistent.\nNotice how OLS is asymptotically consistent with just weak exogeneity, without requiring full exogeneity. This implies that if we only meet weak exogeneity, our OLS estimates will be biased according to theorem 3.2 (since unbiasedness requires strict exogeneity). However, under only weak exogeneity, our OLS estimates will still be asymptotically consistent despite being biased in finite samples.\nThis means that if we have some reason to believe that we do not meet strict exogeneity, if we meet weak exogeneity, as long as our sample size is sufficiently large, our estimates can still be asymptotically consistent and accurate.",

The outcome \\(Y\\) value in these two worlds is called the potential outcomes.\nIf we know the two hypothetical parallel worlds are identical to each other except for treatment \\(D_t\\), then we know any difference in \\(Y\\) outcomes between the two worlds must be a result of treatment \\(D\\). This difference in potential outcomes is called the individual treatment effect \\(\\tau\\).\nHowever, there is an issue: in the real world, we obviously do not have two hypothetical parallel worlds. We only have one world - either unit \\(t\\) gets treated \\(D_t = 1\\) or unit \\(t\\) does not get treated \\(D_t = 0\\). The world we actually live in is called the observed outcome, and the parallel world we do not see is called the counterfactual.\nThe fact that we cannot observe the two parallel worlds, and that the counterfactual is never observable in our real world, is called the fundamental problem of causal inference. Our goal in causal inference will be to somehow approximate/estimate these counterfactuals in order to estimate causal effects.

However, because of the fundamental problem of causal inference, we do not know the counterfactuals.\nAt an individual level, these counterfactuals are almost impossible to estimate, so we typically do not use the individual treatment effect. Instead, we will typically look at the averages of treatment effects. The most common causal estimand (true value in the population) we will use is the average treatment effect.\n\nDefinition 7.4 (Average Treatment Effect) The ATE is the average individual treatment effects \\(\\tau_i\\) in the population.\n\\[\n\\tau_{ATE} = \\E(\\tau_t) \\  = \\  \\E(\\pt - \\pc)  \\ = \\  \\E \\pt - \\E \\pc\n\\]\n\n\nObviously, we do not observe the counterfactual outcomes. However, at a group level, their averages are more easily estimated, which we will explore later in the chapter.\nThe ATE is not the only causal estimand. We will often consider a few other causal estimands.\n\nDefinition 7.5 (Average Treatment Effect on the Treated) The ATT is the average individual treatment effect \\(\\tau_i\\) for only units that were assigned to the treatment group \\(D_i = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\tau_{ATT} = \\E(\\tau_t | D_t = 1) \\ = \\ \\E(\\pt - \\pc | D_t = 1)\n\\]\n\n\nThe ATT is usually not equal to the ATE, but in specific circumstances, they can be equal.\nThe opposite estimand also exists - the average treatment effect on the untreated (ATU). This is typically not something we calculate, but it is used in some proofs.\nSometimes, we also might believe there are heterogenous treatment effects - i.e. some third variable strengthens or weakens the strength of an estimand. For example, perhaps a policy has more positive effects on females than males. Thus, we can also find the ATE conditional on some third variable.\n\nDefinition 7.6 (Conditional Average Treatment Effect) The CATE is the average treatment effect, conditional on some other characteristic/covariate \\(X\\) value:\n\\[\n\\tau_{CATE}(x) = \\E(\\tau_t| X = x) \\ = \\ \\E(\\pt - \\pc|X=x)\n\\]\nThis estimand is also sometimes called the local average treatment effect (LATE).\n\n\nThese causal estimands are all estimands - true population parameters.

    "text": "7.3 Structural Causal Models\nAn alternative causal framework, pioneered by Pearl, is called the structural causal models. This framework uses graphical models (called directed acyclic graphs) to illustrate causality.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery causal graph illustrates how different variables are connected to each other. Each graph contains:\n\nNodes: These are letters that represent different variables.\nDirected Edges: these are arrows that encode causal theories between the variables. For example, if you believe \\(Z\\) causes \\(D\\), you would draw an arrow \\(Z \\rightarrow D\\). These connections are either observable (solid lines) or unobservable (dashed lines).\n\nPaths are any route between any two variables, that do not have to follow the direction of the arrows. For example, in the figure above, between \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\), there are 3 paths:\n\nThe direct path \\(D \\rightarrow Y\\).\nThe inderect/backdoor path \\(D \\leftarrow Q \\rightarrow Y\\).\nThe indirect/backdoor path \\(D \\leftarrow Z \\leftarrow W \\rightarrow Y\\).\n\nThe goal in causal inference is to get rid of all the indirect/backdoor paths, allowing us to isolate the direct relationship between \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\).\nOne way to block a path is through an external intervention. For example, in the figure below, variable \\(D\\) is directly caused by \\(M\\) and \\(Z\\). This allows indirect paths between \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\) to flow between \\(M\\) and \\(Z\\).\nHowever, if we externally decide the value of \\(D\\) (such as through random assignment of \\(D\\)), then we are determining the value of \\(D\\) externally, and \\(Z\\) and \\(M\\) will no longer determine \\(D\\). Thus, the indirect/backdoor paths from \\(Z\\) and \\(M\\) will be eliminated.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, we can block indirect/backdoor paths through conditioning on a set of variables/nodes \\(\\set X\\). A set of nodes \\(\\cal X\\) blocks a path if one of two is true:\n\nA path is blocked if our set of conditioning nodes \\(\\set X\\) includes at least one arrow-emitting node within that path.\nA path is blocked if the path contains a collision node (where multiple arrows point into it), and that collision node is not included in our set of conditioning nodes \\(\\set X\\).\n\nFor example, in the figure above, we can see:\n\nThe path \\(D \\rightarrow P \\rightarrow Y\\) is blocked by a set \\(\\set X = \\{P\\}\\), since \\(P\\) is one arrow emitting node within this path.\nThe path \\(D \\leftarrow M \\rightarrow Y\\) is blocked by a set \\(\\set X = \\{M\\}\\), because \\(M\\) is one arrow emitting node within this path.\nThe path \\(D \\leftarrow Z \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow Y\\) is blocked by either \\(\\set X = \\{M\\}, \\{Z\\}\\) or \\(\\{M, Z\\}\\).\nThe path \\(D \\leftarrow Z \\rightarrow M \\leftarrow Q \\rightarrow Y\\) is blocked by an empty set \\(\\set X = \\varnothing\\), because \\(M\\) is a collider node in this path and we do not need to include it.\n\nWe will discuss the idea of blocking paths more in the quasi-experimental research designs covered in Part III.",

First, we know that \\(Y_t|D_t = 1\\) is the observed potential outcome \\(\\pt\\). We also know that \\(Y_t|D_t = 0\\) is the observed potential outcome \\(\\pc\\). Thus, we can rewrite the above to\n\\[\n\\rho_{D, Y} = \\E(\\pt|D_i = 1) - \\E(\\pc|D_i = 0)\n\\]\nNow, let us do an algebra trick. We know that adding a zero doesn’t change the equality of the equation. Let us add the term \\(\\E(\\pc|D_t = 1)\\), but then also subtract that term, so we are essentially adding a 0. Then we get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_{D, Y} = \\E(\\pt &|D_t = 1) - \\E(\\pc|D_t = 0) \\\\\n& + \\E(\\pc|D_t = 1) - \\E(\\pc|D_t = 1)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nLet us rearrange the order of the terms to get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_{D, Y} & = \\overbrace{\\E(\\pt|D_t = 1) - \\E(\\pc|D_t = 1)}^{\\tau_{ATT}} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\underbrace{+ \\E(\\pc|D_t = 1) - \\E(\\pc|D_t = 0)}_{\\text{selection bias}}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{7.1}\\]\nWe can see that according to definition 7.5, the first part of this correlation between \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\) is the ATT, one of the causal estimands. However, the correlation \\(\\rho_{D,Y}\\) does not only equal the \\(\\tau_{ATT}\\), as there is an extra bit, the selection bias. If this selection bias is not 0, then our correlation is clearly not equal to our ATT.\nLet us look at the selection bias term more carefully:\n\\[\n\\underbrace{+ \\E(\\pc|D_t = 1) - \\E(\\pc|D_t = 0)}_{\\text{selection bias}}\n\\]\nThe first part is the average potential outcome under parallel world \\(D_t = 0\\) for the units that were assigned to treatment \\(D_t = 1\\). The second part is the average potential outcome under parallel world \\(D_t = 0\\) for units that were assigned to control \\(D_t = 0\\).\nIf this term is non-zero, that means the control group and treatment group have different average \\(\\pc\\) values. That means, before our experiment had even started, the control and treatment groups had different baseline potential outcome \\(\\pc\\). If for example, the treatment group \\(D_t = 1\\) initially had a very low \\(\\pc\\), even after treatment with true effect \\(+\\tau\\), their outcome \\(Y_t\\) may still be lower than people who didn’t get the treatment. So, our correlation \\(\\rho_{D,Y}\\) would pick up a negative treatment effect, when the actual treatment effect is positive \\(+\\tau\\).\nA good intuitive example is the question: does going to the hospital improve your life expectancy? If we were to just collect correlation data, we would see that actually, people who went to the hospital have lower life expectancy.\nBut, that is because people who go to the hospital in the first place already have low life expectancy \\(\\pc\\) compared to people who didn’t go. The hospital will cause these people with low life expectancy to have longer lives (treatment effect \\(\\tau\\)), but even with \\(\\pc + \\tau\\), their life expectancy may still be lower than the \\(\\pc\\) of the group who never went to the hospital.\nThus, our correlation measure shows a negative effect of going to the hospital on life expectancy, when in reality, going to the hospital does boost life expectancy, its just people who choose to go to the hospital start off with lower life expectancy than those who do not go.",

An \\(X\\) that causes selection bias is called a confounder.\n\nDefinition 7.7 (Confounder) A confounder is a third variable \\(X\\) that causes selection into treatment \\(D\\) and causes changes in outcome \\(Y\\). If there is such a variable, this creates selection bias, and makes correlation not equal causation.\n\n\nFor example, there is a well known correlation in the real world that ice cream sales are strongly correlated with shark attacks. So does ice cream sales actually cause more shark attacks?\nThe answer is (likely) no. The reason we see this correlation is because of a third variable - the weather. When the weather is warm, more people buy ice cream, and more people go to the ocean, hence increasing the amount of shark attacks.\nWeather is a third variable that we consider a confounder, as it affects both ice cream sales and shark attacks. There is actually no relationship between ice cream sales and shark attacks - the perceived correlation is caused by the confounder weather.\nOur goal in causal inference is to eliminate the effects of the confounders and isolate the effects between treatment and outcome. We can also visualise confounders in a structural causal model:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the figure above, \\(X\\) is confounding the relationship between \\(D \\rightarrow Y\\).

For accurate causal estimation, we need some way to “block” the path through \\(X\\).\nWhy isn’t \\(V\\) a confounder? Well, \\(V\\) does not cause selection into \\(D\\), as the arrow direction shows that \\(D\\) causes \\(V\\). Thus, \\(V\\) is not causing selection bias.

We then run a regression:\n\\[\nX_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 D_t + \\eps_t\n\\]\n\\(\\beta_1\\) will show the difference between \\(\\E(X_t | D_t = 1)\\) and \\(\\E(X_t|D_t = 0)\\). If \\(\\beta_1\\) is not statistically significantly different, then we can conclude the treatment and control groups are similar, and that randomisation has suceeded.\nDo note that the important thing in randomisation (and the assumption of independence) is not that \\(X_t\\) is random between treatment and control, but rather potential outcomes are random. Although, if \\(X_t\\) is random between treatment and control, that generally implies potential outcomes are also random.\n\n\n\nWe can prove that randomisation and the independence assumption allow us to eliminate the selection bias shown in eq. 7.1. Let us start with our correlation from eq. 7.1:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_{D, Y} & = \\overbrace{\\E(\\pt|D_t = 1)- \\E(\\pc|D_t = 1)}^{\\tau_{ATT}} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad + \\underbrace{\\E(\\pc|D_t = 1) - \\E(\\pc|D_t = 0)}_{\\text{selection bias}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nUsing the properties of independence from definition 7.8, we can get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_{D, Y} & = \\underbrace{\\E(\\pt|D_t = 1)- \\E(\\pc|D_t = 1)}_{\\tau_{ATT}} + \\underbrace{\\E \\pc - \\E \\pc}_{\\text{selection bias}} \\\\\n& = \\underbrace{\\E(\\pt|D_t = 1)- \\E(\\pc|D_i = 1)}_{\\tau_{ATT}} + 0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThus, we can see the assumption of independence has removed our selection bias, and allowed us to accurately calculate our \\(\\tau_{ATT}\\) simply by looking at the correlation \\(\\rho_{D,Y}\\).\nWe can also identify the ATE from our correlation \\(\\rho_{D,Y}\\), by simplifying once again using the properties implied by the assumption of independence from definition 7.8:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_{D, Y} & = \\underbrace{\\E(\\pt|D_i = 1)- \\E(\\pc|D_i = 1)}_{\\tau_{ATT}} \\\\\n& = \\underbrace{\\E \\pt - \\E \\pc}_{\\tau_{ATE}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWhich according to definition 7.4, is the ATE. Thus, under randomisation, our correlation measure \\(\\rho_{D, Y} = \\tau_{ATT} = \\tau_{ATE}\\). Recall our correlation measure again \\(\\rho_{D, Y}\\) was simply a comparison of observed outcomes between treatment and control groups:\n\\[\n\\rho_{D, Y} = \\E(Y_t|D_t = 1) - \\E (Y_t | D_t = 0) = \\tau_{ATE} = \\tau_{ATT}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\rho_{D, Y}\\) only requires observed outcomes (not potential), we can calculate \\(\\rho_{D, Y}\\), which is also equal to the ATE and ATT under randomisation. Thus, we have identified a way to find the ATE and ATT with just observed outcomes.",

    "text": "7.7 Randomised Experiments\nSo we have established that randomly assigning treatment and control can allow us to establish that correlation equals causation (under succesfull randomisation only).\nBut how can we actually implement this design? The most simple way is the classic randomisation setup:\n\nWe have \\(N\\) total number of units in our experiment.\nA random subset of \\(N_1\\) will be assigned to treatment, and the remainder are set to control. We can choose \\(N_1\\) to be any number (although 50% of \\(N\\) is the most common).\nWe randomly select individuals into \\(N_1\\) or not, until we reach the number \\(N_1\\), where the remainder will be assigned to control.\n\nHowever, the downside of this traditional method is that technically not every unit has an equal chance of being assigned to treatment - as after \\(N_1\\) has been reached, all remaining units will go into control.\nInstead, we can do bernoulli randomisation. In bernoulli randomisation, we have a probability of being assigned to treatment given by the bernoulli distribution. We do not fix \\(N_1\\) before randomisation, so everyone gets the same probability of being assigned to treatment. This does mean that if we run multiple randomisation trials, each will likely have a different amount of units in treatment \\(N_1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCluster Randomisation\n\n\n\n\n\nCluster randomisation is when we randomly assign units (or have individuals naturally) in groups. Every unit within a group (called a cluster) will get the same treatment. We randomly sample the groups to get the treatment or control.\nFor example, we could randomise development treatment at the village level, or randomise treatment of a cirriculum at the school level.\nThe main reason for this is to prevent SUTVA violations. For example, imagine you are testing the effects of a new curriculum. If you randomise by each student, students will talk to their friends, and treated individuals may teach control individuals about the new curriculum. But by randomising by school (either an entire school gets or does not get the new curriculum), this concern is not a huge issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStratified Randomisation\n\n\n\n\n\nStratified (also called blocked or conditional) randomisation are when randomisation occurs separately within levels of some covariates(s) \\(X\\). Generally, you separate your sample of \\(N\\) units into \\(J\\) subgroups. For example, you could split people up into male or female, then randomly sample within each group, rather than everyone together.\nThe reason you might want to do this is to ensure that both your treatment and control are balanced. For example, let us say you have 4 subjects, with pre-treatment potential outcomes \\(\\pc = \\{2, 2, 8, 8\\}\\).\nIf you are randomly assigning, you have a 33% chance you end up with an assignment where \\(\\{8, 8\\}\\) are placed in one group, and \\(\\{2, 2\\}\\) are placed in another group. In this case, our treatment/control groups would be very different, and this would violate our independence assumption.\nBy stratifying our sample before into two subgroups, with group 1 being \\(\\{2, 2\\}\\) and group 2 being \\(\\{8,8\\}\\), and randomly sampling one from each group into treatment, we are guaranteed to have more balance.\n\n\n\nWhen we are writing a paper, we might want to convince our readers that randomisation has indeed successfully been implemented, and that the assumption of independence has been met. The most common way to check this is with a balance check. We essentially consider a few likely confounders \\(X\\). We then run a regression:\n\\[\nX_t = \\underbrace{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 D_t}_{\\E(X_t|D_t)} + \\eps_t\n\\]\n\\(\\beta_1\\) will show the difference between \\(\\E(X_t | D_t = 1)\\) and \\(\\E(X_t|D_t = 0)\\). If \\(\\beta_1\\) is not statistically significantly different, then we can conclude the treatment and control groups are similar, and that randomisation has succeeded.\nWe can estimate the ATE in a randomisation setting where independence is met simply with a correlation measure, such as a linear model:\n\\[\nY_t = \\underbrace{\\alpha + \\tau D_t}_{\\E(Y_t | D_t)} + \\eps_t\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\tau\\) can be estimated with OLS, GLS, or MLE (although OLS with robust standard errors is generally the preferred estimator). A difference-in-means estimator is also possible.\nSignificance testing will be done with a t-test (?def-ttest) like you do in OLS. Robust standard errors (to account for heteroscedasticity) should be used as a default, unless you can prove homoscedasticity is met. If you are using cluster randomisation, you should use cluster-robust standard errors. Bootstrap inference is also a common choice if your sample size is quite small.\nWhile the linear model is the best way to estimate the ATE specifically, if you are less concerned with the ATE, you can also use other models, such as the logistic model, poisson model, and many more. While the results may not be exactly the ATE, they can be interpreted causally if you are randomising.",

So the formula for variance (?def-var) with strict exogeneity equals the variance of the error term.\nIn the generalised least squares estimator, we assume that the variance-covariance matrix of errors has the form:\n\\[\n\\V(\\b\\eps | \\b X) = \\E(\\b{\\eps\\eps^\\top}) = \\sigma^2 \\b\\Omega\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\sigma^2\\) is an unknown scalar constant, but \\(\\b\\Omega\\) is a known matrix that is equivalent to the population variance-covariance matrix of errors (up to a scalar factor).\nLet us define a matrix \\(\\b\\Omega^{-1/2}\\), which will be the inverse of the square root of \\(\\b\\Omega\\). This means that the following should be true:\n\\[\n\\b\\Omega^{-1/2} \\ \\b\\Omega \\ {\\b\\Omega^{-1/2}}^\\top = \\b I\n\\tag{4.4}\\]\nWe can use \\(\\b\\Omega^{-1/2}\\) to transform our original model \\(\\b y = \\b{X\\beta} + \\b\\eps\\) to get:\n\\[\n\\underbrace{\\b\\Omega^{-1/2}}_{\\b y^*} \\b y = \\underbrace{\\b\\Omega^{-1/2} \\b X}_{\\b X^*} \\b \\beta + \\underbrace{\\b\\Omega^{-1/2} \\b \\eps}_{\\b \\eps^*}\n\\tag{4.5}\\]\nThis transformed model should have spherical errors.

    "text": "4.3 Heteroscedasticity Transformation\nWhen heteroscedasticity (definition 4.1) is present, we could just use the OLS estimator with robust standard errors. However, OLS with robust standard errors is no longer the best linear unbiased estimator, as the Gauss-Markov theorem (?thm-gaussmarkov) depends on spherical errors.\nThe weighted least squares (WLS) estimator is an alternative of OLS (and is considered a special case of the generalised least squares estimator we will see later in the chapter).\nSuppose that our heteroscedasticity is of the form:\n\\[\n\\V(\\eps_t|\\b X) = \\sigma^2 \\  \\Omega(X_t)\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\nWhere \\(\\sigma^2\\) is some constant (can be 1) and \\(\\Omega(X_t)\\) is some function of \\(X_t\\) that explained the difference in error variance between individuals.\nNow, consider the variance of this (modified) error term that is the original error \\(\\eps_t\\) divided by the square root \\(\\Omega(X_t)\\), which is a function of \\(X_t\\):\n\\[\n\\V \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_t)}}\\eps_t \\biggr| X_t \\right)\n\\]\nUsing ?thm-variance, we know \\(\\V(cu) = c^2 \\V(u)\\) if \\(c\\) is a constant and \\(u\\) is a random variable. This function also applies to a function \\(a(x)\\) where \\(\\V(a(x) u) = a(x)^2 \\V(u)\\).

Well it tells us the modified error term \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_i)}} \\eps_t\\) has a variance of constant \\(\\sigma^2\\) for all units \\(i\\), which does not dependent on \\(X_i\\). What does this mean? Well, our modified error term is now meeting homoscedasticity (?def-sphericalerrors)!\nHowever, we obviously cannot just divide the error term by \\(1/\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_t)}\\) - that changes our linear model. What we can though do is divide every term of our linear model by \\(1/\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_t)}\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{Y_t}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_t)}} = \\beta_0\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_t)}}\\right) + \\beta_1 \\left(\\frac{X_{t1}}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_t)}}\\right) + \\dots +  \\frac{\\eps_t}{\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_t)}}\n\\tag{4.2}\\]\nAnd since we divide both side by \\(1/\\sqrt{\\Omega(X_t)}\\), and our model is conditional on individual \\(t\\) (see all the subscripts), that means this model is still “equivalent” to our original linear model.\nThus, the idea of weighted least squares is to “transform” our heteroscedastic linear model into one that meets homoscedasitcity. We can then just use OLS on our new homoscedastic regression, and since homoscedsaticity is met, Gauss-Markov (?thm-gaussmarkov) is met, and our estimator is once again the best linear unbiased estimator.",

    "text": "5.5 Asymptotics and Cramér-Rao\nThe Maximum Likelihood Estimator has some desirable asymptotic properties as sample size \\(n \\rightarrow ∞\\), that make is a very popular estimator in statistics.\nThrough central limit theorem (theorem 2.2), we know asymptotically that \\(\\hat\\theta\\) from MLE will be normally distributed. Through quite complex mathematics, we can also show that the MLE is asymptotically consistent (definition 2.6). Finally, in the last section, we determined the asymptotic variance of the MLE (theorem 5.2). Thus, we know all the asymptotic properties of the MLE.\n\nTheorem 5.3 (Asymptotic Properties of MLE) The maximum likelihood estimator has the following asymptotic distribution:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\b\\theta} \\sim \\mathcal N(\\b\\theta_0, \\b{\\mathcal I}(\\b\\theta_0)^{-1} )\n\\]\nThis means that MLE is asymptotically consistent, asymptotically normal, and has an asymptotic variance of \\(1/\\b{\\mathcal I}(\\b\\theta_0)\\).\n\n\nLet us focus on the asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimator. We see that it is \\(1/\\b{\\mathcal I}(\\b\\theta_0)\\). Why is this important? Let us introduce a new theorem: Cramér-Rao.\n\nTheorem 5.4 (Cramér-Rao) The Cramér-Rao Bound states that for any unbiased estimator, the variance cannot be any lower than the inverse of the fischer information matrix:\n\\[\n\\V \\hat{\\b\\theta} ≥ \\frac{1}{\\b{\\mathcal I}(\\hat{\\b\\theta})}\n\\]\nSince the MLE has that exact variance asymptotically, it is the asymptotically unbiased (consistent) estimator with the least variance.\n\n\nProof: An unbiased estimator \\(\\hat\\theta\\) of a parameter \\(\\theta\\), its estimates are a function of its sample \\(\\b y\\), so we will call the unbiased estimator \\(\\hat\\theta(\\b y)\\). We know an unbiased estimator \\(\\hat\\theta(\\b y)\\) should have a expectation equal to true population parameter, which also implies\n\\[\n\\E \\hat\\theta(\\b\\y) = \\theta \\quad \\implies \\quad \\E[\\hat\\theta(\\b y) - \\theta \\ | \\ \\theta \\ ] = 0\n\\]\nRegardless of the value of \\(\\theta\\). We can rewrite expectation with the definition of expectation (definition 1.2) to get:\n\\[\n\\int\\left( \\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta \\right) f_Y(y; \\theta)dy = 0\n\\]\nSince this expectation is independent of \\(\\theta\\) (true for all \\(\\theta\\)), the derivative in respect to \\(\\theta\\) should be 0 (since \\(\\theta\\) does not cause change in the expectation), and we can compute the derivative with product rule:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n0 & = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\int \\left(\\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta \\right)f_Y(y ; \\theta)dy \\\\\n0 & = \\int \\left(\\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta \\right)\\frac{\\partial f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}dy - \\int f_Y dy\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWhere I have shortened \\(f_Y(y; \\theta)\\) to just \\(f_Y\\) for simplicity. Since \\(f_Y\\) is a PDF, \\(\\int f_Y dy = 1\\), so we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n0 & = \\int \\left(\\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta \\right)\\frac{\\partial f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}dy - 1\\\\\n1 & = \\int \\left(\\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta \\right)\\frac{\\partial f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}dy\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe can substitute \\(\\frac{\\partial f_Y}{\\partial \\theta} = f_y \\frac{\\partial \\log f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}\\). You can prove this is true by using chain rule. Thus, we get:\n\\[\n1 = \\int \\left(\\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta \\right) f_Y \\frac{\\partial \\log f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}dy\n\\]\nWe can factor \\(f_Y\\) in half to get:\n\\[\n1 = \\int \\left( (\\hat\\theta - \\theta) \\sqrt{f_Y} \\right) \\left(\\sqrt{f_Y} \\frac{\\partial \\log f_Y}{\\partial \\theta} \\right)dy\n\\tag{5.1}\\]\nWe know by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequalty, that this must be true:\n\\[\n\\int \\left( (\\hat\\theta - \\theta) \\sqrt{f_Y} \\right) \\left(\\sqrt{f_Y} \\frac{\\partial \\log f_Y}{\\partial \\theta} \\right)dy ≤ \\left(\\int (\\hat\\theta - \\theta)^2 f_Y dy \\right) \\left( \\int f_Y \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\log f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^2 dy \\right)\n\\]\nAnd we know the left side from eq. 5.1 is equal to 1, so we get the inequality:\n\\[\n1 ≤ \\left(\\int (\\hat\\theta - \\theta)^2 f_Y dy \\right) \\left( \\int f_Y \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\log f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^2 dy \\right)\n\\]\nWe can see both parts of the right side are in the form of expectations (definition 1.2), so let us write them as expectations.\n\\[\n1 ≤ \\color{blue}{\\E[(\\hat\\theta - \\theta)^2]} \\cdot  \\color{purple}{\\E\\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\log f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^2 \\right]}\n\\]\nWe can see the blue is the expectation of an unbiased estimator (since \\(\\E \\hat\\theta = \\theta\\)), and the purple part is the fisher information matrix (definition 5.4). Thus, solving for the variance, we get:\n\\[\n\\V \\hat\\theta ≤ \\frac{1}{\\mathcal I(\\theta)}\n\\]\nThis is the lowest bound any unbiased estimator’s variance can be, meaning any unbiased estimator who attains this variance is the unbiased estimator with the least variance.\nWe know that the maximum likelihood estimator is unbiased asymptotically (consistent), and its asymptotic variance is \\(1/\\mathcal I(\\theta)\\). Thus, the maximum likelihood estimator is the unbiased estimator with the least variance, and is the best asymptotic unbiased estimator.",

    "text": "5.6 Cramér-Rao Bound\nLet us focus on the asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimator. We see that it is \\(1/\\b{\\mathcal I}(\\b\\theta_0)\\). Why is this important? Let us introduce a new theorem: Cramér-Rao.\n\nTheorem 5.4 (Cramér-Rao) The Cramér-Rao Bound states that for any unbiased estimator, the variance cannot be any lower than the inverse of the fischer information matrix:\n\\[\n\\V \\hat{\\b\\theta} ≥ \\frac{1}{\\b{\\mathcal I}(\\b\\theta)}\n\\]\nSince the MLE has that exact variance asymptotically, it is the asymptotically unbiased (consistent) estimator with the least variance.\n\n\nProof: An unbiased estimator \\(\\hat\\theta\\) of a parameter \\(\\theta\\), its estimates are a function of its sample \\(\\b y\\), so we will call the unbiased estimator \\(\\hat\\theta(\\b y)\\). We know an unbiased estimator \\(\\hat\\theta(\\b y)\\) should have a expectation equal to true population parameter, which also implies\n\\[\n\\E \\hat\\theta(\\b y) = \\theta \\quad \\implies \\quad \\E[\\hat\\theta(\\b y) - \\theta \\ | \\ \\theta \\ ] = 0\n\\]\nRegardless of the value of \\(\\theta\\). We can rewrite expectation with the definition of expectation (?def-exp) to get:\n\\[\n\\int\\left( \\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta \\right) f_Y(y; \\theta)dy = 0\n\\]\nSince this expectation is independent of \\(\\theta\\) (true for all \\(\\theta\\)), the derivative in respect to \\(\\theta\\) should be 0 (since \\(\\theta\\) does not cause change in the expectation), and we can compute the derivative with product rule:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n0 & = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\int \\left(\\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta \\right)f_Y(y ; \\theta)dy \\\\\n0 & = \\int \\left(\\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta \\right)\\frac{\\partial f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}dy - \\int f_Y dy\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWhere I have shortened \\(f_Y(y; \\theta)\\) to \\(f_Y\\) for simplicity. Since \\(f_Y\\) is a PDF, \\(\\int f_Y dy = 1\\), thus\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n0 & = \\int \\left(\\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta \\right)\\frac{\\partial f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}dy - 1\\\\\n1 & = \\int \\left(\\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta \\right)\\frac{\\partial f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}dy\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe can substitute \\(\\frac{\\partial f_Y}{\\partial \\theta} = f_y \\frac{\\partial \\log f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}\\). You can prove this is true by using chain rule. Thus,\n\\[\n1 = \\int \\left(\\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta \\right) f_Y \\frac{\\partial \\log f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}dy\n\\]\nWe can factor \\(f_Y\\) in half to get:\n\\[\n1 = \\int \\left( (\\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta) \\sqrt{f_Y} \\right) \\left(\\sqrt{f_Y} \\frac{\\partial \\log f_Y}{\\partial \\theta} \\right)dy\n\\tag{5.1}\\]\nWe know by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequalty, that this must be true:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\int \\left( (\\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta) \\sqrt{f_Y} \\right)&  \\left(\\sqrt{f_Y} \\frac{\\partial \\log f_Y}{\\partial \\theta} \\right)dy \\\\  ≤ \\ & \\left(\\int (\\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta)^2 f_Y dy \\right) \\left( \\int f_Y \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\log f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^2 dy \\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAnd we know the left side from eq. 5.1 is equal to 1, so we get the inequality:\n\\[\n1 ≤ \\left(\\int (\\hat\\theta(y) - \\theta)^2 f_Y dy \\right) \\left( \\int f_Y \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\log f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^2 dy \\right)\n\\]\nWe can see both parts of the right side are in the form of expectations (?def-exp), so let us write them as expectations.\n\\[\n1 ≤ \\color{blue}{\\E[(\\hat\\theta - \\theta)^2]} \\cdot  \\color{purple}{\\E\\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\log f_Y}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^2 \\right]}\n\\]\nWe can see the blue is the variance (?def-var) of an unbiased estimator (since \\(\\E \\hat\\theta = \\theta\\)), and the purple part is the fisher information matrix (definition 5.4). Thus, isolating the variance on one side, we get\n\\[\n\\V \\hat\\theta ≤ \\frac{1}{\\mathcal I(\\theta)}\n\\]\nThis is the lowest bound any unbiased estimator’s variance can be, meaning any unbiased estimator who attains this variance is the unbiased estimator with the least variance.\nWe know that the maximum likelihood estimator is unbiased asymptotically (consistent), and its asymptotic variance is \\(1/\\mathcal I(\\theta)\\). Thus, the maximum likelihood estimator is the unbiased estimator with the least variance, and is the best asymptotic unbiased estimator.",

    "text": "5.7 Newton-Raphson Algorithm\nWe know that the MLE estimates \\(\\hat\\theta\\) are obtained by minimising the score function \\(s(\\b\\theta, \\b y)\\). However, in many cases, there exists no closed form-analytical solution. Thus, we have to use iterated algorithms to minimise the score function.\nThe most common method is the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Suppose \\(\\theta\\) is a scalar of potential parameters. For values of \\(\\theta\\) that are close to the true population parameter \\(\\theta_0\\), the first order taylor series expansion of \\(s(\\theta, \\b y)\\) about \\(\\theta_0\\) states:\n\\[\ns(\\theta; \\b y) \\approx s(\\theta_0, \\b y) + s'(\\theta_0; \\b y)(\\theta - \\theta_0)\n\\]\nWhere \\(s'(\\theta_0; \\b y)\\) is the first derivative of the score function \\(s(\\theta_0, \\b y)\\) at the true population value \\(\\theta_0\\). We know from definition 5.5 that the first derivative of the score function is defined by the negative observed information \\(-\\b I(\\theta_0)\\). Thus, we get:\n\\[\ns(\\theta; \\b y) \\approx s(\\theta_0, \\b y)  - \\b I(\\theta_0)(\\theta - \\theta_0)\n\\]\nNow, we can get our \\(\\theta\\) that makes the score function equal 0 by setting \\(s(\\theta; \\b y) = 0\\), and then solving for \\(\\theta\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n0 &  \\approx s(\\theta_0, \\b y)  - \\b I(\\theta_0)(\\theta - \\theta_0) \\\\\n\\b I(\\theta_0)(\\theta - \\theta_0) & \\approx s(\\theta_0, \\b y) \\\\\n\\theta - \\theta_0 & \\approx \\b I(\\theta_0)^{-1}  s(\\theta_0, \\b y) \\\\\n\\theta & \\approx \\theta_0 + \\b I(\\theta_0)^{-1} s(\\theta_0, \\b y)\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5.2}\\]\nSo know we have identified the \\(\\theta\\) that makes our score function equal to 0, which also maximises the log-likelihood \\(\\ell\\) and likelihood \\(L\\). However, there is an issue - our solution for \\(\\theta\\) includes \\(\\theta_0\\), the unknown true population parameter. Since \\(\\theta_0\\) is unknown, we cannot use this formula directly.\nInstead, we use an iterative procedure. We start with some initial value \\(\\theta^{(0)}\\) that is randomly chosen. Then, we use that \\(\\theta^{(0)}\\) to “update” to get a new \\(\\theta^{(1)}\\), based on eq. 5.2:\n\\[\n\\theta^{(1)} = \\theta^{(0)} + \\b I(\\theta^{(0)})^{-1}s(\\theta^{(0)}; \\b y)\n\\]\nThen, with our new \\(\\theta^{(1)}\\), we update to get \\(\\theta^{(2)}\\):\n\\[\n\\theta^{(2)} = \\theta^{(1)} + \\b I(\\theta^{(1)})^{-1}s(\\theta^{(1)}; \\b y)\n\\]\nAnd we keep doing this using \\(\\theta^{(m)}\\) to update to \\(\\theta^{(m+1)}\\):\n\\[\n\\theta^{(m+1)} = \\theta^{(m)} + \\b I(\\theta^{(m)})^{-1}s(\\theta^{(m)}; \\b y)\n\\tag{5.3}\\]\nAnd we keep doing this until the difference between \\(\\theta^{(m+1)}\\) and \\(\\theta^{(m)}\\) becomes very small (based on some pre-specified threshold). This is because our formula in eq. 5.2 is:\n\\[\n\\theta \\approx \\theta_0 + \\b I(\\theta_0)^{-1} s(\\theta_0, \\b y)\n\\]\nSo, if \\(\\theta^{(m+1)}\\) is very close to \\(\\theta^{(m)}\\) in eq. 5.3, we know that \\(\\theta^{(m+1)}\\) is approaching the true value \\(\\theta_0\\).\nAn alternative to the Newton-Raphson algorithm is the Fisher-scoring algorithm, which does the same thing, but using the fisher information matrix \\(\\mathcal I(\\theta)\\) (definition 5.4) instead of the observed information matrix \\(I(\\theta)\\), when \\(\\mathcal I (\\theta)\\) is not too difficult to compute. Fisher-scoring is the method most common for generalised linear models (that we will cover in later chapters).",

Using this fact, and the variance of MLE (theorem 5.2), we can do hypothesis testing with one parameter with the wald test:\n\nDefinition 5.6 (Wald Test) The wald test can determine if a parameter estimated by MLE is statistically significant. The wald test statistic is given by\n\\[\nW = \\left( \\frac{\\hat\\theta - H_0}{se(\\hat\\theta)} \\right)^2 = \\frac{(\\hat\\theta - H_0)^2}{\\V \\hat\\theta}\n\\]\nWhere \\(H_0\\) is the value of \\(\\theta\\) established by our null hypothesis. We then use a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with 1 degrees of freedom to obtain the p-value.\n\n\nIf our p-value is less than 0.05, we can conclude that our null hypothesis is incorrect. We could also use a z-test, which would produce the exact same result as the wald test:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{\\hat\\theta - H_0}{se(\\hat\\theta)}\n\\]\nAnd we consult a standard normal distribution \\(\\mathcal N(0, 1)\\) to get a p-value, and the interpretation is the same as the wald test.\n\nFor testing multiple coefficients at once, like the f-test for OLS (?def-ftest), we can use the Likelihood Ratio test. Like the f-test, the likelihood ratio test compares two models:\n\n\\(M_0 : Y_t = \\beta_0 + \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g \\beta_j X_{tj} + \\eps_i\\) (the smaller null model with \\(g\\) parameters).\n\\(M_a : Y_t = \\beta_0 + \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g \\beta_j X_{tj} + \\sum\\limits_{j=g+1}^p \\beta_j X_{tj} \\eps_i\\) (the bigger model with the original \\(g\\) parameters in the null + additional parameters up to \\(p\\)).\n\nIn the F-test, we used the \\(R^2\\) metric (?def-rsquared) to compare the two models. However, \\(R^2\\) only exists in OLS, not MLE.\nInstead, for MLE, we will use the likelihood function \\(L\\). After all, the likelihood \\(L\\) (definition 5.1) gives us the probability of observing a sample given parameters \\(\\b\\theta\\). If the probability is higher, that likely means our model is better. Thus, the likelihood ratio test compares the difference between the likelihoods of two models.\n\nDefinition 5.7 (Likelihood Ratio Test) The likelihood ratio test compares a smaller model \\(M_0\\) and larger model \\(M_a\\). The test statistic \\(L^2\\) is given by\n\\[\nL^2 = 2 \\log \\left(\\frac{L_a}{L_0}\\right) = 2 \\log (L_a) - 2 \\log (L_0)\n\\]\nWhere \\(L\\) is the likelihood of the model given by the likelihood function. Then, we consult a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of extra parameters in model \\(M_a\\) compared to \\(M_0\\).\n\n\nIf the p-value is less than 0.05, that means our \\(M_a\\) model (and all of its extra coefficients) are statistically significant.",

    "text": "5.10 Information Criterion Statistics\nRecall that in OLS, we had the \\(R^2\\) metric that tells us how “good” the fit of our model is. For MLE, we can also have metrics that tell us the fit of our model, called information criterion statistics.\nRecall that likelihood function \\(L\\) (definition 5.1) is the probability of observing a particular sample given parameters \\(\\b\\theta\\). If the probability is higher, that likely means our model is better. Thus, likelihood \\(L\\) allows us to compare different models.\nHowever, we often prefer simple models over more complex models. If we have two models with the same likelihood \\(L\\), but one has 40 parameters and the other has 5, you would prefer the one with 5, as it is far more efficient and achieves the same performance.\nThe information criterion statistics use an adjusted likelihood \\(L\\) accounting for the number of parameters to avoid good models that don’t have too many parameters. The most commonly used is the Akaike’s Information Criterion.\n\nDefinition 5.8 (AIC) Akaike’s Information Criterion can be used to measure the fit of models fitted with MLE.\n\\[\nAIC = -2 \\log L + 2p\n\\]\nWhere \\(L\\) is the likelihood of the model, and \\(p\\) is the number of parameters in the model. The lower the AIC is, the better the model is considered.\n\n\nAIC can be used to compare different models, including models that are not nested like in the likelihood ratio test. However, unlike \\(R^2\\), it does not have a real “substantive/real-world” meaning. The value itself means very little. An alternative to AIC is the Bayesian Information Criterion.\n\nDefinition 5.9 (BIC) Bayesian Information Criterion can be used to measure the fit of models fitted with MLE.\n\\[\nBIC = p \\log n - 2 \\log L\n\\]\nWhere \\(p\\) is the number of parameters in the model, \\(n\\) is the number of observations, and \\(L\\) is the likelihood of the given model. The lower the BIC is, the better the model is considered.\n\n\nThe BIC tends to penalise extra parameters more strongly than AIC. Generally, when comparing two models, AIC and BIC will agree.",

Let \\((x_1, \\dots, x_n)\\) be a sample from a population with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). We want to use our method of moments estimator to find the true value of these two parameters.\nSince we have two parameters, we will need two moments. Our first moment \\(\\mu_1\\) is\n\\[\n\\mu_1 = \\E(X^1) = \\mu \\ \\approx \\ \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n x_t\n\\]\nAnd our second population moment is\n\\[\n\\mu_2 = \\E(X^2) \\ \\approx \\ \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^nx_t^2\n\\]\nWe can rewrite our second population moment from \\(\\E(X^2)\\) as the following:\n\\[\n\\E(X^2) = \\E(X-\\mu)^2 + 2\\mu \\E(X) - \\E(\\mu)^2\n\\]\nYou can prove this by multiplying out and cancelling the right hand side. We can simplify this expression using the definition of variance (?def-var) and property of expectations to get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\E(X^2) & = \\E(X-\\mu)^2 + 2\\mu \\E(X) - \\E(\\mu)^2 \\\\\n& = \\sigma^2 + 2\\mu \\mu - \\mu^2 \\\\\n& = \\sigma^2 + \\mu^2\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThus, we see the second population moment is equivalent to \\(\\sigma^2 + \\mu^2\\).

From now on, we will focus on more complex cases of the method of moments, and how they can be used to address some of the issues with past estimators.",

    "text": "6.4 Instrumental Variables\nRecall the OLS method of moments condition (definition 6.1):\n\\[\n\\E(\\b{X^\\top \\eps}) = 0\n\\]\nAs mentioned above, this is equivalent to the exogeneity condition (?def-strictexog) - that the regressors \\(\\b X\\) are uncorrelated with the error term \\(\\b \\eps\\). However, what if this is violated? Our OLS estimates become biased, because exogeneity is a key condition in establishing the unbiasedness of OLS (?thm-olsunbiased).\nThe instrumental variables estimator is a solution to this issue. The idea is to find a third variable (or more) \\(Z\\), that does meet this condition of exogeneity. Then, we will have the new condition\n\\[\n\\E(\\b{Z^\\top \\eps}) = 0\n\\]\nand we will have no exogeneity if \\(Z\\) is not correlated with the error term. We then use these instruments \\(Z\\) to predict \\(X\\), which will get us the parts of \\(X\\) that are explained by \\(Z\\) (and thus, uncorrelated with the error term). Then, we can use that exogenous part of \\(X\\) to estimate the relationship with \\(Y\\). However, this hinges on \\(Z\\) meeting that moments condition.\n\nDefinition 6.2 (Assumptions of Instruments) For instrument(s) \\(Z\\) to meet the moment condition \\(\\E(\\b{Z^\\top \\eps}) = 0\\), the following facts must be true:\n\n\\(Z\\) must be exogenous/ignorable, i.e. \\(Cov(Z, \\eps) = 0\\).\n\\(Z\\) must be relevant, i.e. \\(Cov(Z, X) ≠ 0\\).\n\\(Z\\) must meet the exclusions restriction (which is implied by exogenous). This means that \\(Z\\) cannot have an independent effect on \\(Y\\), outside of its impact on \\(Y\\) through \\(X\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe classic instrument setup is as above. We want to find the relationship between \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\). However, there is some unobserved variable \\(U\\) that is not in our regression, so it is in our error term \\(\\eps\\). But because \\(U\\) is correlated with \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\) and in the error term \\(\\eps\\), it implies \\(D\\) is correlated with the error term \\(\\eps\\), violating exogeneity.\nTo solve this, we introduce an instrument \\(Z\\). By using \\(Z\\) to predict \\(D\\), we are only using the part of \\(D\\) that is explained by \\(Z\\). That part of \\(D\\) is not explained by \\(U\\), so that part of \\(D\\) is now exogenous, and we can estimate the relationship between \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure shows potential violations of the assumptions of instrument \\(Z\\), when trying to measure the relationship between \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\). Finding a valid instrument is very difficult, but possible. However, it typically takes a lot of domain knowledge to get a good instrument.",

We can rewrite our matrices in the form of vectors, scalars, and summation, just as we did in the proof of OLS consistency (?thm-olsconsistent). We thus get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\b\\beta}^* & = \\b\\beta + (\\b{Z^\\top X})^{-1} \\b{Z^\\top\\eps} \\\\\n& = \\b\\beta + \\left(\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n \\b z_t \\b x_t^\\top \\right)^{-1} \\left(\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n \\b z_t \\eps_t \\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, let us do a little algebra trick as follows:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\b\\beta}^* = \\b\\beta + \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n \\b z_t \\b x_t^\\top \\right)^{-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n \\b z_t \\eps_t \\right)\n\\]\nThe reason we can do this is because the first \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) is inversed as \\(\\frac{1}{n}^{-1}\\), so this cancels out the second one, maintaining the equality of our equation.\nNow, we want to prove \\(\\mathrm{plim}\\hat{\\b\\beta}^* = \\b\\beta\\), so let us take the probability limit of both sides:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{plim}\\hat{\\b\\beta}^* = \\mathrm{plim}\\b\\beta + \\left(\\mathrm{plim}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n \\b z_t \\b x_t^\\top \\right)^{-1} \\left(\\mathrm{plim}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^n \\b z_t \\eps_t \\right)\n\\]\nWe know the probability limit of a constant is itself. Look at the other two terms on the right: they take the form of sample averages \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\). Using the law of large numbers (theorem 2.1), we can simplify to:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{plim}\\hat{\\b\\beta}^*  = \\b\\beta + (\\E(\\b z_t \\b x_t^\\top))^{-1} \\underbrace{\\E(\\b z_t \\eps_t)}_{= \\ 0} = \\b\\beta\n\\]\nAnd we know \\(\\E(\\b z_t \\eps_t) = 0\\) because this is the same condition as the moment condition \\(\\E(\\b{Z^\\top \\eps}) = 0\\), just written in terms of individual observations. Thus, the Instrumental variables estimator is asymptotically consistent.\nIt can also be shown that the asymptotic variance of the instrumental variables estimator, under the assumption of spherical errors is\n\\[\n\\V \\hat{\\b\\beta}^* = \\sigma^2(\\b{Z^\\top X})^{-1} \\b{Z^\\top Z} (\\b{X^\\top Z})^{-1}\n\\]\nAlthough the proof of this is beyond the scope of this chapter.

Well, let us first start with the CATE from definition 7.6:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau_{CATE}(x) & = \\E(Y_{1i} - Y_{0i} \\ | \\ \\mathcal X_i = x) \\\\\n& = \\E(Y_{1i} | \\mathcal X_i = x) - \\E(Y_{0i}|\\mathcal X_i = x) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, from the properties implied by conditional ignorability given in definition 8.1, we get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau_{CATE}(x) & = \\E(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) - \\E(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x) \\\\\n& = \\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) - \\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAnd the second step above is because \\(Y_{1i}|D_i = 1\\) and \\(Y_{0i}|D_i = 0\\) are observable outcomes. Thus, with independence, we can identify the CATE with just observed outcomes.\nNow, let us consider the ATE, which is \\(\\E(Y_{1i} - Y_{0i})\\). From the definition of a continuous random variable’s expectation given in ?def-exp, we can rewrite the ATE as\n\\[\n\\tau_{ATE} = \\int\\tau_{CATE}(x) \\P(\\mathcal x) dy\n\\]\nWhich is a weighted average. We established in ?eq-soocate that we can identify the CATE. Thus, we can plug ?eq-soocate into the ATE to get our identified ATE:\n\\[\n\\tau_{ATE} = \\int [\\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) - \\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x)] \\P(x) dy\n\\]\nAnd all the values in this equation are observed outcomes \\(Y_i\\), meaning if we control for set of confounders \\(\\mathcal X\\), our correlation becomes a causal effect.\nWe can also do a very similar proof for identifying the ATT. The conditional-ATT is equal to the CATE based on the assumption of conditional ignorability. Using the definition of the ATT from definition 7.5 and the definition of expectation given in ?def-exp, we see the ATT equals:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau_{ATT} & = \\int \\tau_{CATE}(x) \\P(x|D_i = 1) dy \\\\\n& = \\int [\\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 1, \\mathcal X_i = x) - \\E(Y_{i}|D_i = 0, \\mathcal X_i = x)] \\P(x|D_i = 1) dy\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAnd all the \\(Y_i\\) here are observed, meaning we can identify the ATT.\nAssuming we meet the assumptions given in definition 8.1, there are multiple estimators, including regression, matching, and weighting, which we will discuss in more detail in the chapter on causal estimation.",

They must be linked to both \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\).\nBad controls are any variable \\(W\\) that is caused by \\(D\\), i.e. \\(D \\rightarrow W\\). We do not need to control for this because \\(W\\) isn’t causing selection into \\(D\\), it is actually itself caused by \\(D\\).\nAnother bad control is a variable \\(Z\\) that only causes \\(D\\), and not \\(Y\\). This reduces the variation in \\(D\\) (since we are now only using the part of \\(D\\) caused by \\(Y\\)), which may amplify any other confounders unaccounted for.\nNeutral controls are variables that only cause \\(Y\\) and are not associated with \\(D\\). They do not affect the causal identification, but can reduce our standard errors of our estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 8.1 (Selection on Observables) There are 2 assumptions needed to identify causal effects in the selections on observables framework.\nConditional Ignorability (also called conditional independence) means that among units \\(i\\) with identical confounder values \\(\\mathcal X_i\\), treatment \\(D_i\\) is as-if randomly assigned.

    "text": "8.2 Instruments and Non-Compliance\nWhen we assign individuals to treatment/control in randomised experiments, we often cannot guarantee that individuals will actually follow through with treatment. Sometimes, someone who was supposed to get treatment refuses treatment, and sometimes, someone who shouldn’t get the treatment decides to get treatment.\nWe can formalise this idea. Let us assume an encouragement \\(Z_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\), which is our treatment assignment. Then, we have the treatment variable \\(D_i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\), which is someone who actually took the treatment or not. Given this framework, we can divide all units \\(i\\) into 4 categories:\n\nCompliers: People who comply with encouragement \\(Z_i\\). Their \\(Z_i = D_i\\).\nAlways-takers: People who no matter what encouragement \\(Z_i\\) is, always take treatment.\nNever-takers: People who no matter their encouragement \\(Z_i\\) is, never take treatment.\nDefiers: People who do the opposite of encouragement \\(Z_i\\), so always \\(D_i ≠ Z_i\\).\n\nWe can show what will happen with all 4 types of people in a table, called the principal strata:\n\n\n\n\n\\(Z_i = 1\\)\n\\(Z_i = 0\\)\n\n\n\\(D_i = 1\\)\nComplier/Always-Taker\nDefier/Always-Taker\n\n\n\\(D_i = 0\\)\nDefier/Never-Taker\nComplier/Never-Taker\n\n\n\nThe idea of the non-compliance designs is to use our encouragement/treatment assignment \\(Z\\) as an instrument for \\(D\\) - actually taking the treatment. This can solve any concerns we might have regarding selection into non-compliance.\nOne causal estimand that we can estimate is the Intent To Treat (ITT), which is essentially the ATE of \\(Z\\) on \\(Y\\), ignoring if people actually took the treatment or not. This is essentially the affect of encouragement. If there is any non-compliance, then the ITT will not equal the ATE.\n\\[\n\\tau_{ITT} = \\E(Y_i|Z_i = 1) - \\E(Y_i | Z_i = 0)\n\\]\nThis is quite easily estimatable in non-compliance randomisation settings, since \\(Z\\) is randomly assigned. Thus, we can calculate the ITT with a linear regression:\n\\[\nY_i = \\alpha + \\tau_{ITT} Z_i + \\eps_i\n\\]\nHowever, we might not care about the ITT. We might want the actual effect of \\(D\\) on \\(Y\\). An alternative is to find the Average Treatment Effect on only compliers, called the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) (a version of the CATE from definition 7.6). We need a few assumptions:\n\nDefinition 8.2 (Instrumental Variables Assumptions) There are 4 assumptions for us to identify the LATE. The first 3 are the normal assumptions from the IV estimator.\n\nRelevance: \\(Z\\) must be correlated to \\(D\\). Or in other words, compilers must exist, or else, encouragement would not affect treatment.\nIgnorability/Exogneity: There is no backdoor path between \\(Z\\) and \\(D\\), and no backdoor path between \\(Z\\) and \\(Y\\) (we can do controls/selection on observables to account for this).\nExclusions Restriction: \\(Z\\) must only have an effect on \\(Y\\) through \\(D\\). \\(Z\\) must not have any independent effect on \\(Y\\).\nMonotonicity: There are no defiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Examples of Violations\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure below contains some visual examples of violations of the above to faciliate understanding of these assumptions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us show how we can prove the LATE is identifiable under these assumptions. First, the ITT itself in ?eq-itt is identifiable under exogeneity/ignorability alone. Now, let us define \\(c\\) as compliers, \\(a\\) as always-takers, \\(n\\) as never-takers, and \\(d\\) as defiers. We can break down the ITT into a weighted average:\n\\[\n\\tau_{ITT} = \\tau_{ITT}^c \\P(c) + \\tau_{ITT}^a \\P(a) + \\tau_{ITT}^n \\P(n) + \\tau_{ITT}^d \\P(d)\n\\]\nWe know that under our assumption of monotonicity, we assume no defiers, so \\(\\P(d) = 0\\):\n\\[\n\\tau_{ITT} = \\tau_{ITT}^c \\P(c) + \\tau_{ITT}^a \\P(a) + \\tau_{ITT}^n \\P(n)\n\\]\nOur exclusions restriction says that \\(Z\\) has no affect on \\(Y\\). Remember that the ITT from ?eq-itt is the relationship between \\(Z\\) and \\(Y\\). But since always-takers and never-takers ignore \\(Z\\) when deciding treatment, \\(Z\\) has no effect of them on \\(Y\\). Thus, we can further simplify:\n\\[\n\\tau_{ITT} = \\tau_{ITT}^c \\P(c)\n\\]\nRemember that the \\(\\tau_{ITT}\\) for compliers, \\(\\tau_{ITT}^c\\), is our LATE that we want to identify. So, let us isolate it to get:\n\\[\n\\tau_{LATE} = \\frac{\\tau_{ITT}}{\\P(c)} \\ = \\ \\frac{\\E(Y_i | Z_i = 1) - \\E(Y_i | Z_i = 0)}{\\E(D_i | Z_i = 1) - \\E(D_i | Z_i = 0)}\n\\]\nThe LATE is interpreted as the ATE of the compliers. This can be tricky to interpret sometimes, as you cannot actually identify who the compliers are, and different encouragements \\(Z\\) can result in different compliers.\nThe LATE is also generally not equal to the ATE or ATT without further assumptions. When there is only one-sided non-compliance when people who are not encouraged cannot get the treatment, the LATE does equal the ATT.",
