# **Median Voter Theory**

### The Downsian Model

Two candidates $j \in \{A, B\}$ are competing in an election for political office. Both candidates only have one goal - to win the election. Their utility functions are as follows:

$$
u_j = \begin{cases}
R \quad \text{if win election} \\
0 \quad \text{if lose election}
\end{cases}
$$

For the election, each candidate $j \in \{A, B \}$ can choose a platform $p_j \in [-1, 1]$.

The citizens, who will vote in the election, each have a preferred policy $q^i \in [-1, 1]$. Citizens' preferred policies $q^i$ are uniformly distributed within this continuum.

Citizens have single peaked symmetric preferences around their $q^i$. Citizens will vote for the candidate who's policy $p_j$ is closest to $q_i$.

The timing of the game is as follows:

1.  Each politician $j \in \{A, B\}$ will select platform $p_j \in [-1, 1]$.
2.  Voters observe $p_A, p_B$, and vote $e_i \in \{A, B \}$.
3.  The politician with most votes wins, and payoffs are realised.

Assume that if there is a tie, there is a coin toss to determine the election.

<br />

### Equilibrium Outcome

Since each player only cares about winning the election, and gets 0 payoff if they lose, we only need to focus on the probability of each candidate winning. Both candidates want to maximise their chances of winning.

$$
\max\limits_{p_j \in [0, 1]} \underbrace{Pr(e=j|p_j,p_{-j})}_{\text{Pr } j \text{ wins given chosen policies}}
$$

Since there are two candidates, this implies that to win the election, a candidate must win 50% of the votes.

Since voter's preferences are single peaked, this means that for either candidate to win, the 50% of votes they win must be in a continuum: i.e. they cannot win the voter at $q^i = -1$ and $q_i = 1$ if they do not win the voters in between.

Under these assumptions, the median voter - whose position is exactly the 50th percentile of voters, becomes pivotal. It is not possible to win a continuum of voters more than 50% without winning the median voter.

Thus, the median voter is the pivotal vote that you need to win.

How can candidates $j \in \{A, B\}$ win the pivotal voter? Candidates win a voter's vote if they are the closes to the voter's preferred policy.

Thus, both parties must be closer than the other to the median voter's policy. Each party will move closer, until they both converge on the median voter.

Let us denote $q^m$ as the median voter's policy. Thus, the **median voter theory** predicts both party's chosen positions will converge at $q^m$:

$$
p_A^* = p_B^* = q^m
$$

At this equilibrium, there is a tie - both candidates win 50% of the vote, and thus, both have 50% probability of winning the election.

If either player moves away from this position, they will lose the median voter, and lose the election. Thus, there exists no profitable deviation from this equilibrium.

<br />

### Empirical Evidence

The median voter theory thus argues that both parties should converge at the median voter's preferences.

But is this actually the case? Do parties really converge at the same platform?

The Manifesto Project by the New York Times looked at US elections between 2000 and 2016. As shown by the figure below, clearly, both parties did not converge (and in fact, diverged 2012-onwards).

![](images/clipboard-386823128.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

Ansolabehere, Snyder, and Stewart (2001) surveyed some candidates from 1996. The area between the two lines is the "median" area. Clearly, a significant amount of candidates do not converge.

![](images/clipboard-437192753.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

Further studies, including Bonica (2014) and Lee et al (2004), run other designs, such as regression discontinuities. All find divergence in party positions, not convergence.

Thus, there lacks empirical proof of consistent convergence. Of course, sometimes it occurs, but it is clearly not a given.

<br />

<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **Potential Explanations for Divergence**

### Assumptions of the Downsian Model

Why is there no convergence of parties to the median voter, as was predicted by the Downsian Model? One obvious place to look is at the assumptions in the Downsian Model. Every formal model makes assumptions. Perhaps, the assumptions of the Downsian Model do not make sense.

Some assumptions of the Downsian Model are as follows:

1.  Candidates only want to win elections, and do not care about what policies they choose, as long as they win elections.
2.  Citizens' preferred policies are distributed uniformly in $q^i \in [-1, 1]$.
3.  There are only two parties.
4.  The policy space is one-dimensional, rather than multidimensional.

Let us test each assumption one by one, and see if this causes our equilibrium outcome to change.

<br />

### Policy-Seeking Candidates

We assumed in the Downsian Model, that all candidates care about is winning the election (Rent-seeking).

However, if we think about the real world, this isn't really the case. It is hard to imagine that in order to win an election, Bernie Sanders would forgo everything he has fought for. Politicians like Bernie clearly have some utility derived from sticking with their beliefs and principles (Policy-seeking).

Let us take the Downsian model, but adjust the utility of the candidates $j \in \{A, B\}$ to reflect this policy-seeking nature.

Let us say party $A$ wants a policy as close as possible to $-1$. The more they move away from $-1$, the more they lose utility. For party $B$, let us say their preferred policy is $1$, and the more they move away from this, the more sad they become.

The final implemented policy of the winning party $p$, is determined by who wins the election. If you lose the election, you have to deal with the winner's preferred policy. Let us define $\pi(p_A, p_B)$ as the probability of candidate $A$ winning the election given the chosen $p_A$ and $p_B$:

$$
u_A(p_A) = \underbrace{\pi(p_A, p_B)}_{\text{Pr A wins}}\underbrace{(-(p_A + 1)^2)}_{\text{A's utility for }p_A} + \underbrace{(1-\pi(p_A, p_B))}_{\text{Pr A loses}}\underbrace{(-(p_B + 1)^2)}_{\text{A's utility for }p_B}
$$

$$
u_B(p_B) =  \underbrace{(1-\pi(p_A, p_B))}_{\text{Pr B wins}}\underbrace{(-(p_B - 1)^2)}_{\text{B's utility for }p_B} + \underbrace{\pi(p_A, p_B)}_{\text{Pr B loses}}\underbrace{(-(p_A - 1)^2)}_{\text{B's utility for }p_A}
$$

What is the equilibrium of this game? [Surprisingly, it is still the median voter's position $q^m$.]{.underline}

Why? The key is that if a party loses an election, they have to deal with their opponents policy $p$. Thus, you are willing to win the election at all costs, because you do not want your opponent to implement their policy.

For example, if it was a far-left candidate versus a far-right candidate, the far left candidate would be incentivised to move closer to the median voter's position $q^m$, thus winning the election, and preventing the far-left policies they hate.

Thus, even with policy-seeking candidates, the equilibrium still suggests that both parties converge at $q^m$. So, policy seeking is not the reason we see divergence in the real world.

<br />

### Voters are Non-Uniformly Distributed

One of the assumptions of the Downsian model is that citizen's preferred policies are distributed uniformly in $[-1, 1]$.

What if citizens were instead distributed normally, or heavily skewed, or heavily polarised with no one in the centre?

Well, it actually does not matter how citizens are distributed at all. [The median voter still remains the equilibrium outcome]{.underline}:

$$
p_A^* = p_B^* = q^m
$$

Why? Well be definition, the median voter is the 50th percentile. And to win the election, you need 50% or more of the vote. Thus, the median voter is always pivotal.

The median voter's position might change. If the data is very skewed right in $[-1, 1]$, $q^m$ could be something like 0.5. But, the median voter is still the voter who decides the election, so both parties will still converge there.

Thus, no matter the distribution of the voters, both parties still converge at the median voter's position $q^m$.

<br />

### More than 2 Parties

The Downsian model assumes that there are only 2 parties, $j \in \{A, B\}$. However, this seems unrealistic - many countries have more than 2 parties in elections. Even the United States has the libertarians and the greens.

Let us adjust the downsian model to have candidates $j \in \{A, B, C\}$. Is the equilibrium still at the median voter $q^m$?

The answer is no! [We no longer have convergence when there are more than 2 parties.]{.underline}

To prove this, we have to think in terms of profitable deviations. If all three parties locate themselves at $q^m$, they will all have a $\frac{1}{3}$ chance of winning the election.

However, if one party $j$ deviates by a small amount $\epsilon$ to a position $q^m + \epsilon$, the game changes dramatically. If party $j$ deviates to the right by 1%, they are now closer to all players on the right of them, which consist of 49% of the votes. The other two candidates will share the 51% between them, so each gets 25.5%. Thus, party $j$ gets the largest share of the vote.

Thus, by deviating slightly from the median to $q^m + \epsilon$, the deviating party $j$ will win the election. Thus, a profitable deviation exists, and convergence will not occur.

<br />

### Multidimensional Policy Space

In the Downsian model, we assumed that voters and candidates choose between policies $[-1, 1]$, which is a single dimension $\mathbb R^1$.

But this is not realistic - every election has many different policy dimensions that parties compete on. You can take different positions on the economy, on social issues, on immigration, on free trade, and much more. Thus, a one-dimensional policy space is likely not realistic.

What if we adapt the Downsian model to $\mathbb R^n$ where $n>1$? Is there still convergence at the median voter $q^m$?

The answer is no! [There is no longer convergence at the median voter's preference $q^m$.]{.underline} To illustrate why, let us consider a divide-the-budget game.

3 legislators $i = 1, 2, 3$ have to divide a budget between there three constituencies, with each constituency receiving $q_i$ amount of funds. There is only a limited amount of money available, so $q_1 + q_2 + q_3 = 1$.

To approve a budget distribution, a majority of legislators (so 2) must agree on the budget. What is the Nash Equilibrium of this game?

The answer is that [there is no Nash Equilibrium]{.underline}. This is because for any proposed budget, there is always another budget which at least 2 players will prefer.

For example, let us say we have the budget:

$$
(q_1 = a, \ q_2 = b, \ q_3 = c)
$$

Since only two players have to agree, they can completely cut the share out of one legislator, and divide it between them two:

$$
(q_1 = 0, \ q_2 = b + \frac{a}{2}, \ q_3 = c + \frac{a}{2})
$$

And once again, 2 players can take the third player's share, and divide it between them two:

$$
(q_1 = c, \ q_2 = b + a, \ q_c = 0)
$$

For every possible budget proposal, there is always one way to cut out one player, and get the other two on board. Thus, there is no equilibrium.

We can model a multidimensional Downsian Model in the same way. Each “dimension” of policy, like environmental, defense, social, etc., is a different budget allocation. Each party will always be able to “outflank” the other party by diverting budget away from one issue and giving it to another, making some citizens happier. Thus, there is no Nash Equilibria is the Downsian Model has multiple policy dimensions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **Competence in Elections**

### Electoral Model with Competence

So far, we have focused on voters voting exclusively on policy. What about voters voting on competence?

Let us assume that there are only 3 policy positions in our policy space: $p_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ (we can think of this as left, centrist, and right). Voters preferred policy $q^i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ as well, however, we will not define the distribution of voters (it could be uniform, skewed, or any distribution).

There are two parties $j \in \{A, B\}$ who want to win the election. However, party $A$ is widely considered by voters as the "more competent" voter, and thus, if party $A$ wins, all voters will get an extra payoff of $\delta \in (0, 1)$. We can define voter utility as:

$$
u_i(p) = \underbrace{-|p - q^i|}_{\text{utility from } p} + \underbrace{I(p_A,p_B)\delta}_{\text{valence if A wins}}
$$

Where $p$ is the winning party's policy position, $q^i$ is the voter's preferred policy position, and $I(p_A, p_B)$ is an indicator function where if party $A$ wins, $I(p_A, p_B) = 1$, and win party $B$ wins, $I(p_A, p_B) = 0$.

Importantly, no parties know the exact location of the median voter. They only know that the median is at -1 with probability $\alpha$, located at 1 with probability $\alpha$, and located at 0 with probability $1- 2\alpha$. Essentially, $\alpha \in (0, \frac{1}{2})$ captures the polarisation of the electorate.

The model basically says that competence does not supsrsede policy, but when voters are indifferent between two parties' policies, they will always prefer the more competent candidate.

<br />

### Equilibrium Outcome

We can write out the game in a matrix for easier understanding:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
& p_B = -1 & p_B = 0 & p_B = 1 \\
p_A = -1 & (1,0) & (\alpha, 1 - \alpha) & (1- \alpha, \alpha) \\
p_A = 0 & (1 - \alpha, \alpha) & (1, 0) & (1- \alpha, \alpha) \\
p_A = 1 & (1- \alpha, \alpha) & (\alpha, 1- \alpha)& (1, 0)
\end{bmatrix}
$$

There is no pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. However, there is a mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium.

Let us look at party $A$'s best responses while player $B$ mixes. Let us define $Pr(p_B = 0) = q$, and $Pr(p_B = -1) = Pr(p_B = 1) = \frac{1-q}{2}$.

$$
\begin{split}
u_A(p_A = -1) & = 1 \cdot Pr(p_B = -1) +  \alpha \cdot Pr(p_B = 0) + (1-\alpha) \cdot Pr(p_B = 1) \\
& = 1 \left( \frac{1-q}{2}\right) + \alpha q + (1- \alpha)\frac{1-q}{2} \\
& =  \underbrace{\frac{1-q}{2}}_{\text{same as}} + \alpha q +  \underbrace{\frac{1-q}{2}}_{\text{same as}} - \frac{\alpha(1-q)}{2} \\
& = \underbrace{1-q}_{\text{summed}} + \alpha q - \frac{\alpha}{2} + \frac{\alpha q}{2} \\
& = 1-q + \frac{3 \alpha q}{2}-\frac{\alpha}{2} \\
\end{split}
$$

<br />

$$
\begin{split}
u_A(p_A = 0) & = (1-\alpha) \cdot Pr(p_B = -1) + 1 \cdot Pr(p_B = 0) + (1-\alpha) \cdot Pr(p_B = 1) \\
& = \underbrace{(1-\alpha)\frac{1-q}{2}}_{\text{same as}} + 1q + \underbrace{(1-\alpha)\frac{1-q}{2}}_{\text{same as}} \\
& = (1-q)(1- \alpha) + q \\
& = \underbrace{1 - \alpha - q + q\alpha}_{\text{expanded out}} + q \\
& = 1 - \alpha + q\alpha
\end{split}
$$

For candidate $A$ to have a mixed strategy, they must be indifferent between the two. Thus:

$$
\begin{split}
u_A(p_A = -1) & = u_A(p_A = 0) \\
1 - q - \frac{3 \alpha q}{2} - \frac{\alpha}{2} & = 1 - \alpha - q \alpha \\
2 - 2q + 3 q \alpha - \alpha & = 2 - 2\alpha + 2 q \alpha \\
-2 + q \alpha & = - \alpha \\
-q(2 - \alpha) & = - \alpha \\
q = \frac{\alpha}{2 - \alpha}
\end{split}
$$

Let us look at party $B$'s best responses while player $B$ mixes. Let us define $Pr(p_A = 0) = p$, and $Pr(p_A = -1) = Pr(p_A = 1) = \frac{1-p}{2}$.

$$
\begin{split}
u_B(p_B = -1) & = \underbrace{0 \cdot Pr(p_A = -1)}_{= \ 0} + \alpha \cdot Pr(p_A = 0) + \alpha \cdot Pr(p_A = 1) \\
& = \alpha p + \alpha \left(\frac{1-p}{2}\right) \\
& = \alpha p + \frac{\alpha}{2} - \frac{\alpha p}{2} \\
& = \frac{\alpha p}{2} + \frac{\alpha}{2}
\end{split}
$$

<br />

$$
\begin{split}
u_B(p_B = 0) & = (1-\alpha) \cdot Pr(p_A = -1) + \underbrace{0 \cdot Pr(p_A = 0)}_{= \ 0} + (1-\alpha) \cdot Pr(p_A = 1) \\
& = (1- \alpha)\left( \frac{1-p}{2} \right) + (1- \alpha)\left( \frac{1-p}{2} \right) \\
& = (1- \alpha) (1-p) \\
& = 1 - \alpha -p + p \alpha
\end{split}
$$

For candidate $B$ to have a mixed strategy, they must be indifferent between the two. Thus:

$$
\begin{split}
u_B(p_B = -1) & = u_B(p_B = 0) \\
\frac{\alpha p}{2} + \frac{\alpha}{2} & = 1 - \alpha -p + p \alpha \\
\alpha p + \alpha & = 2 - 2\alpha - 2p + 2p \alpha \\
- \alpha p + 2p & = 2 -3 \alpha \\
p(2 - \alpha) & = 2 - 3 \alpha \\
p & = \frac{2-3 \alpha}{2 - \alpha}
\end{split}
$$

Thus, we have found the probabilities that sustain a mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium.

Candidate $A$ will play $p_A = 0$ at probability $\frac{2 - 3 \alpha}{2 - \alpha}$, and split the remainder between $p_A = -1$ and $p_A = 1$.

Candidate $B$ will play $p_B = 0$ at probability $\frac{\alpha}{2 - \alpha}$, and split the remainder between $p_B = -1$ and $p_B = 1$.

<br />

### Interpretation of the Model

We can graph the probability of each player playing the centrist policy 0, given different values of $\alpha$ (which is polarisation of the elite). Note in this graph, candidate $L$ refers to candidate $A$, and candidate $R$ refers to candidate $B$.

![](images/clipboard-2676628971.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

We can see the disadvantaged candidate $B$ is far less likely to propose playing the centrist policy 0. Why is this?

Well, if both candidates go to the centrist policy 0, who wins? In the Downsian model, the probability is 50% of winning for both candidates. However, because voters prefer the more competent candidate $A$, if both converge to the same policy, the voters will vote for candidate $A$. That means if both candidates converge to the centre, $A$ wins 100% of the time, and $B$ cannot win.

Thus, disadvantaged candidate $B$ has an incentive to become more extreme. Only by differentiating themselves, can they have a chance of winning. They have to hope that the median is indeed at -1 or 1.

Candidate $A$ thus has the incentive of copying candidate $B$'s platform. This is because if they both have the same platform, the more competent $A$ will win with 100% probability.

What implications does this have? If we look at many elections, we will see the generally more perceived "incompetent" candidate will try to adopt more extreme positions.

For example, during the 2024 UK general election, the unpopular and widely regarded as less-competent Rishi Sunak began to adopt pretty wild policies, such as a National Service plan. Unfortunately for Sunak, the median voter was not at this more extreme end.

Another example could be Donald Trump, who is generally not seen as "competent" or "experienced" as many of his adversaries. He gambled by differentiating himself with populist outside policies. Luckily for Trump, the US median voter was indeed much more right-wing and populist than many had thought, and this propelled Trump into the White House twice.
