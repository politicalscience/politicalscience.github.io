# Indefinite Integrals {#integrals}

In the previous 5 lessons, we have focused on finding the derivative of a function. However, we are sometimes interested in finding the opposite of the derivative.

The opposite of a derivative, is an antiderivative, or an integral. If $f$ is a function, its derivative $F$ would be the following:

$$
F(x) = \int f(x)dx
$$

<br />

For example, take this equation:

$$
y = x^2
$$

If we take the derivative, we get:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x
$$

If we then do the antiderivative/integral of our derivatve, we return (almost) to our original equation:

$$
\int 2x \space dx = x^2 + c
$$

<br />

What is up with the $+c$ in our integral? Unlike finding the derivative, which there is only one of per function, there are mutliple integrals for every function.

Why? Well, remember when we took a derivative of a constant? The result would be 0.

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[c] = 0
$$

<br />

Well, when we try to take the antiderivative, there could be a constant $c$ that doesn't occur in our function, since it is a $0$.

Thus, when we find the integral of a function, we always add $+c$ at the end of our equation, to account for this potential missing constant.

<br />

You might wonder, why am I talking about **indefinite** integrals, not all integrals? Well, as you will see in the next lesson, the integral $F$ is also equal to the area under the curve of $f$.

-   A **definite** integral would be about calculating the area between two points $x=a$ and $x=b$.

-   An **indefinite** integral, as in our case, is just concerned with finding the integral $F$, without concern for the area between $x=a$ and $x=b$

<br />

Integrals can be more difficult to calculate than derivatives.

-   In fact, there are many integrals which cannot be calculated without computers.

However, luckily for us, integrals are also used far less than derivatives in Political Science.

<br />

But what are some of the uses of integrals?

1.  Integrals are essential to statistical inference: the chance of something occuring is the area under the probability distribution, which we can find by taking the integral of the probability distribution.
2.  Integrals also help calculate expected utility, which is relevant for Game Theory.

# Calculating Integrals {#calculations}

These are a few of the most common rules of integrals that can assist us in finding integrals of a function:

$$
1.\space \int a f(x)dx = a*\int f(x)dx
$$

$$
2. \int [f(x) + g(x)]dx = \int f(x)dx + \int g(x)dx
$$

$$
3. \int x^n dx = \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + c
$$

$$
4. \int e^x dx = e^x + c
$$

$$
5. \int \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln x + c
$$

$$
6. \int e^{f(x)} f'(x)dx = e^{f(x)}+c
$$

$$
7. \int [f(x)]^n f'(x)dx = \frac{1}{n+1}[f(x)]^{n+1} + c
$$

$$
8. \int \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}dx = \ln f(x) + c
$$

<br />

As you have probably noticed, a lot of these rules are the opposite of the derivative rules we introduced previously.

<br />

#### Example 1:

Find $F(x) = \int f(x)dx$ where $f(x) = 3x^2$

$$
F(x) = \int 3x^2 dx
$$

$$
\text{using the rule: } \int a f(x)dx = a*\int f(x)dx, \text{ we know:}
$$

$$
F(x) = 3 * \int x^2
$$

$$
\text{using the rule: } \int x^n dx = \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + c, \text{ we know:}
$$

$$
F(x) = 3 * \frac{1}{2+1} x^{2+1} + c
$$

$$
F(x) = 3 * \frac{1}{3} x^3 + c
$$

$$
F(x) = x^3 + c
$$

<br />

#### Example 2:

Find $F(x) = \int f(x)dx$ where $f(x) = 2x + 1$

$$
F(x) = \int (2x + 1)dx
$$

$$
\text{using the rule: } \int [f(x) + g(x)]dx = \int f(x)dx + \int g(x)dx, \text{ we know:}
$$

$$
F(x) = \int (2x)dx + \int (1)dx
$$

$$
\text{rewritten as: } F(x) = \int (2x^1)dx + \int (x^0)
$$

$$
\text{using the rule: } \int a f(x)dx = a*\int f(x)dx, \text{ we know:}
$$

$$
F(x) = 2*\int (x^1)dx + \int (x^0)
$$

$$
\text{using the rule: } \int x^n dx = \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + c, \text{ we know:}
$$

$$
F(x) = 2 * \frac{1}{1+1} x^{1+1} + c + \frac{1}{0+1} x^{0+1} + c
$$

$$
F(x) = 2 * \frac{1}{2} x^2 + c + 1*x^1 + c
$$

$$
F(x) = x^2 + x + c
$$

<br />

#### Example 3:

Find $F(x) = \int f(x)dx$ where $f(x) = e^x e^{e^x}$

$$
F(x) = \int e^x e^{e^x} dx
$$

$$
\text{we know that } \frac{d}{dx}[e^x] = e^x
$$

$$
\text{using the rule: } \int e^{f(x)} f'(x)dx = e^{f(x)}+c, \text{ we know:}
$$

$$
F(x) = e^{e^x} + c
$$
