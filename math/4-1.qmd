# Intro to Linear Algebra {#intro}

Linear Algebra is a broad topic, that covers systems of linear equations, matrices, and vectors.

<br />

Matrices and Vectors are very important for political science:

-   You can represent each variable in statistics as a vector, with each observation's $x_1, x_2, x_3,...,x_n$ is essentially a $n$-long vector.

-   If we have multiple dependent variables (so multiple vectors), we can represent them in a matrix, with each column can be a different variable.

We use these vectors and matrices to directly compute coefficients of regressions and other estimators.

<br />

Matrices are also used in Game Theory for political science:

-   Game theory, when we have to solve for optimal behaviour, you often have multiple players and different payoffs.

-   You will often have different variables that you need to solve an equation, which incorporates linear algebra, matrices, and vectors.

<br />

More advanced topics, including Markov Chains, Monte Carlo Simulations, and Advanced Game Theory models, also are based in Linear Algebra.

# Scalars and Vectors {#scalars}

#### Scalars

**Scalars** are any element, for example, a real number.

-   For example, a scalar could be a real number $X_1 \in R$

    -   NOTE: $\in$ means "in", and $R$ means the set of all real numbers.

-   Or $X_2 \in R$

-   Or any other single number you have used in your entire life, like $1, 2, 3...$

<br />

#### Vectors

**Vectors** are a collection of scalars.

-   All a vector is, is a collection of scalars (any element, for example, a real number - see above).

<br />

Vectors have 2 types - row and column:

-   A row vector has multiple components/elements $x_1, x_2,..., x_n$ arranged in a row (horizontal).

-   A column vector has multiple components/elements $x_1, x_2,..., x_n$ arranged in a column (vertical).

<br />

The **dimension** of a vector is the number of components/elements.

-   For example, a vector of components $x_1, x_2, x_3$ is a 3 dimensional vector.

-   For example, a vector of components $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ is a 4 dimensional vector.

<br />

Vector notation is as follows:

-   Generally, the components of a vector are numbered, so we can easily tell the position of each component.

    -   Ex. $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$

-   The vector itself is generally bolded: $\mathbf{x}$. However, when this is impractical to notate, we often put an arrow above the variable to indicate a vector: $\overrightarrow{x}$

-   Scalars are just regular variables: $x$

# Graphical Representation of Vectors {#graphical}

In the previous section, we discussed how vectors are simply, a collection of components/elements/scalars.

However, we can actually graph vectors:

-   This relates to the "dimension" of a vector.

<br />

Let us take a 2 dimensional vector as an example:

-   The vector has 2 components: $x_1, x_2$

We can view $x_1$ as the value along the $x$ axis, and $x_2$ as the value along the $y$ axis.

-   We can plot the point on the graph where $x=x_1$ and $y=x_2$ meet

The vector is the **direct line from the origin** $0,0$ **to the point** $(x=x_1, y=x_2)$

<br />

For example, take the following 2 dimensional vector $x_1, x_2$, where $x_1 = 2$ and $x_2 = 3$

-   Let us view $x_1$ as the value along the x axis, and $x_2$ as the value along the $y$ axis.

-   Thus, that means the $x$ axis has a value of $2$, and the $y$ axis has a value of $3$

Then, let us find the point $(x=x_1=2, y=x_2=3)$ and plot it, then drawing a straight line from the origin to that point. This is our vector:

<br />

#### Key Features of the Graphical Vector

Here are a few key features:

-   The **head** of the vector is the point we plotted earlier. We put an arrow on the head.

-   The **tail** of the vector is the part that touches the origin $(0, 0)$.

It is useful to sometimes draw out vectors, as it can help visualise operations we will apply to these vectors.

<br />

We previously talked about the **dimension** of the vector.

Now, let us talk about the **length** of a vector (this is not the same thing as dimension).

-   The length of the vector is simply, well, the length of the vector in our graphical representation above.

-   With a 2 dimensional vector, we can use the quadratic formula ( $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ ) to find the length.

-   The length is often called the norm, and is notated by two double bars on each side: $||\overrightarrow{a}||$

For vectors with more dimensions, the length/norm is as follows:

$$
||\overrightarrow{a}|| = \sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2}
$$

<br />

#### Higher Dimensions

For higher dimensional vectors, we would simply add more axes to a higher dimensional plane:

-   For example, with the vector $x_1, x_2, x_3$, we would have 3 dimensions. Thus, we could assign each element as the distance on the $x, y, z$ axes, and draw a line from the origin to the point $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ in the 3-dimensional plot.

-   Thus, the vector $x_1, x_2,...,x_n$ would be in an $n$-dimensional space.

For more dimensions, the more "trickier" to represent it, especially for anything above 3 dimensions.

-   Thus, it is often helpful to not imagine this with too high dimensions, and just stick to the "combination of components" definition of vectors.
