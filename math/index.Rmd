While most political scientists will not need to be math wizards, it is useful to have a baseline understanding of some math to help with the statistics and data science approaches commonly used in political science. This course covers some of the key topics in algebra, calculus, and linear algebra needed to understand the methods behind political science.

Prerequisits: Algebra to the level of a typical secondary education.

Note: You don't need to study this course from beginning to end - you can focus on particular areas where you may struggle with.
