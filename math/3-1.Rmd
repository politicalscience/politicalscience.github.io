# Slope and Concavity {#slope}

#### Slope

From the previous lesson [2.1 Introduction to Derivatives](https://politicalscience.github.io/math/2-1.html), we know that a derivative is a function $f'(x)$, whose value at $x$ is the rate of change of $f(x)$ at $x$.

From $f'(x)$ is the rate of change of $f(x)$ at $x$, we know the following:

1.  If $f'(x) < 0$, then $f(x)$ is decreasing
2.  If $f'(x) > 0$, then $f(x)$ is increasing
3.  If $f(x) = 0$, then $f(x)$ is neither increasing or decreasing.

<br />

#### Concavity

Concavity is whether a curve opens upward or downward. A function is **concave up** when the slope is increasing, and a function is **concave down** when the slope is decreasing.

How do we know if the slope is increasing or decreasing at some point on $x$?

-   Well, the derivative is, by definition, the rate of change of a function at x.

-   So, the rate of change, of the slope (rate of change) of the original $f$, tells us the rate of change of the slope of $f$

-   The rate of change, of the rate of change, is simply the derivative of the derivative, or, in other words, the second-order derivative $f''(x)$ of $f(x)$

<br />

Thus, from $f''(x)$ as the rate of change of the rate of change of $f(x)$ at $x$, we know the following:

1.  If $f''(x) < 0$, then $f(x)$ is concave down
2.  If $f''(x) > 0$, then $f(x)$ is concave up
3.  If $f''(x) = 0$, then $f(x)$ is neither concave up or down

<br />

#### Example:

Take $f(x) = x^2 + 2$. When is $f(x)$ increasing, decreasing, and is it concave up or down?

-   Let us first find $f'(x)$. Using power rule, we know $f'(x) = 2x$

-   So when is $f(x)$ increasing or decreasing.

    -   When $f'(x) > 0$, then $f(x)$ is increasing. $f'(x) = 2x$ is greater than 0 for range $(0 < x < ∞)$

    -   When $f'(x) < 0$, then $f(x)$ is decreasing. $f'(x) = 2x$ is less than 0 for the range $(-∞ < x < 0)$

-   What is the concavity of $f'(x)$? We know we can tell this with $f''(x)$.

    -   To find $f''(x)$, we take the derivative of $f'(x)$.

    -   $f'(x) = 2x$, so by power rule, we know $f''(x) = 2$

    -   $2 > 0$, so the function is concave up.

    -   This makes sense, since if we visualise the graph of $f(x) = x^2 + 2$, it is a parabola opening upward

# Critical Points {#critical}

Critical points are defined as one of the following, given $D$ is the domain where function $f$ is defined:

1.  Any point of $D$ where $f'(x)$ = 0
2.  Any point of $D$ where $f'(x)$ does not exist (any $D$ where $f$ is not differentiable)
3.  Any endpoint that is in $D$

<br />

# Maxima and Minima {#maxmin}

Maxima and Minima are a subset of the critical points - i.e., the are included in the critical points, but they do not make up all the critical points.

There are two types of Maxima. A Maximum of $f$ exists at $x=x_0$ by the following definitions:

1.  Local Maxima: where $f(x_0) > f(x)$ for all $x$ in some interval containing $x_0$
2.  Global Maxima: where $f(x_0) > f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain $D$ of $f$

There are two types of Minima. A Mininum of $f$ exists at $x=x_0$ by the following definitions:

1.  Local Minima: where $f(x_0) < f(x)$ for all $x$ in some interval containing $x_0$
2.  Global Minima: where $f(x_0) < f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain $D$ of $f$

<br />

When identifying maxima and minima, we first identify local ones, before we identify global ones. We can use the **Second Derivative Test of Maxima/Minima** to tell whether a point is a maximum or minium of $f(x)$

-   Local Maximum exists at $x_0$ if $f'(x_0) = 0$ and $f''(x_0) < 0$

-   Local Mininum exists at $x_0$ if $f'(x_0) = 0$ and $f''(x_0) > 0$

<br />

If $f'(x_0) = 0$ and $f''(x_0) = 0$, we might have a global maxima/minima, however, we cannot be sure.

-   Why? Well it is possible for no global max or min to exist - such as a function that goes from $-∞$ to $∞$

<br />

However, there are 3 situations where we can identify global max and min when this condition is met.

1.  Functions with only one critical point/only one local maximum/mininum. When this happens, we know that point is the global max or min.
2.  Globally concave up or concave down: If $f''(x)$ never is zero, then there cannot be more than one critical point. That critical point is the global maximum if $f''(x) < 0$, and global mininum if $f''>0$
3.  Functions over a closed and bounded intervals must have both a global maximum or global mininum.

If $f'(x_0) = 0$, yet no maxima/minima are at $x_0$, this is considered a **saddle point**.

<br />

Of course, if you have a graphing programme like desmos, you can also quickly identify maxmima/minima.

<br />

#### Example:

Find any critical points, and identify if they are a maximum, mininum, or saddle point, of the function $f(x) = x^2 + 2$

-   We know the following criteria about critical points:

    1.  Any point of $D$ where $f'(x)$ = 0

    2.  Any point of $D$ where $f'(x)$ does not exist (any $D$ where $f$ is not differentiable)

    3.  Any endpoint that is in $D$

-   Let us first find $f'(x)$. Using power rule, we know $f'(x) = 2x$

-   We can quickly eliminate criteria 2 and 3, as $f'(x) = 2x$ is defined from $(-∞,∞)$, and there is no interval given so no endpoints in $D$.

-   Now, we should solve for the zeroes: $f(x) = 0$

    -   $0 = 2x$, thus $f(x) = 0$ when $x = 0$

-   Thus, we know there is a critical point at $x=0$

-   Now, is this a local maxima or minima?

    -   Through power rule, we know $f''(x) = 2$

    -   Thus, we know there is a local mininum, since the conditions $f'(x_0) = 0$ and $f''(x_0) > 0$ are met.

-   Now is there a global mininum? Yes, since there is only one critical point and one local mininum, it must be the global mininum.
