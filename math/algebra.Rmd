# Definition of Function {#function}

[Dimensionality](#1001) \| [Definition of Function](#1002)

Functions are the backbone of regression and predictive analyses in Political Science. Thus, it is important to understand what functions are.

<br />

### Dimensionality {#1001}

Before we describe functions, we need to understand **Dimensionality**:

-   $R^1$ , is a one dimensional line. It is the set of all real numbers between $-∞$ to $∞$.

    -   In other words, it is the real number line.

<br />

We can increase the number of dimensions to more than 1.

-   $R^2$ is a two dimensional plane. Dimension 1 is the set of all real numbers between $-∞$ and $∞$, and Dimensions 2 is another set of all real numbers between $-∞$ and $∞$.

    -   Think of a cartesian plane where we graph lines in 2 dimensions, $x$ and $y$

-   $R^3$ is a 3-dimensional space, with $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, each the set of all real numbers between $-∞$ and $∞$.

    -   Think of a coordinate location system, for example, in the game Minecraft. $x$ is longitude, $y$ is latitude, and $z$ is height.

-   $R^n$ is an $n$-dimensional space, where each of the $n$ number of axes contains the set of all real numbers between $-∞$ and $∞$.

    -   This is often referred to as the Euclidean space.

<br />

### Definition of Function {#1002}

A function is a rule, or a transformation, that takes an input of $R^n$, and returns one, and only one number in $R^1$

-   A function of one variable is an input of $R^1$ , and an output of $R^1$

    -   For example, $f(x) = x + 1$. This function takes an input of some $x$ in $R^1$, and returns a real number in $R^1$

-   A function of two variables is an input of $R^2$, and an output of $R^1$

    -   For example, $f(x) = x2 + y2$. This function takes an input of some $x$ and $y$ in $R^2$, and returns a real number in $R^1$

<br />

In political science, we often use $x$ to represent the input variable, and $y$ to represent the output variable.

If there are more than one input variables (input $R^n$ when $n > 1$ ), we often put subscripts on the $x$'s, such as: $x_1, x_2, ... , x_p$

Input variables $x$ in the space $R^n$ are called **independent** or **explanatory** variables. The output variable $y$ in space $R^1$ is called a **dependent** or **response** variable.

<br />

Some key properties of functions:

-   The **domain** of $f(x)$ is the set of numbers in $X$ at which $f(x)$ is defined.

-   The **range** of $f(x)$ is the elements of $Y$ assigned by $f(x)$ to elements of $X$

    -   This is sometimes called the **image** when input $R^n$ has $n > 1$

<br />

Common types of functions that we will see in Political Science include:

-   Monomials: in the form of $f(x) = ax^k$

-   Polynomials - the sum of monomials. The degree of a polynomial is its highest powered term.

    -   Example: $f(x) = 5x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 4$ is a 3rd degree polynomial

-   Rational Functions: the ratio of two polynomials.

    -   Example: $f(x)=\frac{x2+1}{x2-2x+1}$

-   Exponential Functions: when $x$ is the the exponent

    -   Example: $f(x)=2^x$

-   Linear functions: polynomials with degree 1: $f(x) = mx + b$

    -   These are very important for linear regression.

# Zeroes, Limits, and Continuity {#zeroes}

Zeroes \| Limits \| Definition of Continuity

### Zeroes (Or Roots) {#2001}

Zeroes (or Roots) are the values of the input of a function, where the output of the function equals $0$.

-   Essentially, the value of $x$ when $f(x) = 0$

These are important in Political Science, as they are important in finding equilibria, as well as maximum likelihood estimation.

<br />

To solve for Zeroes/Roots, simply set the function $f(x) = 0$, and solve for $x$.

-   Alternatively, you can use a graphing programme, such as Desmos, to plot the function, and find at what $x$ does it cross the line $y = 0$

<br />

Some functions have multiple roots (especially polynomials). For example, consider the function $f(x) = x^2 - 16$. Let us solve for the roots:

$f(x) = x^2 - 16$, now set $f(x) = 0$

$0 = x^2 - 16$

$x^2 = 16$

$x = ±4$

<br />

For quadratic equations (polynomials of degree 2), there is a formula called the **Quadratic Formula** which solves for the roots:

$x = \frac{-b ± \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$

Given the quadratic in the form of $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$

Note: the quadratic formula generally returns 2 real zeroes/roots, but this is not always the case. Remember to check both the $+$ and $-$ in the numerator.

<br />

### Limits {#2002}

A limit is when a function approaches some specific $y$ value $L$, as $x$ moves toward some value $c$.

-   Often, this specific $y$ value $L$in question is either $L=0$ or $L=±∞$

For a limit to exist, it must approach the same $y$ value $L$ from both sides of $x = c$

-   For example, if from the left as $x$ approaches $c$, $y$ approaches $∞$, and if from the right as $x$ appraoches $c$, $y$ approaches $∞$, we have a limit.

-   But, if from the left as $x$ approaches $c$, $y$ approaches $∞$, and if from the right as $x$ appraoches $c$, $y$ approaches $-∞$, we do not have a limit, because the $y$ value being approached on either side is not the same.

If a limit exists, we can say $\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) = L$

-   Note: $f(x)$ does not need to be defined at $x=c$ for the limit to exist. It just must approach the same $y=L$ on both sides infinitely close to $x=c$.

<br />

Let us assume $f$ and $g$ are functions with $\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) = A$ and $\lim_{x \rightarrow c} g(x) = B$. The following properties include:

-   $\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} [f(x)+g(x)] = \lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) + \lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} g(x)$

-   $\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} \alpha f(x) = \alpha \lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)$

-   $\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) * g(x) = [\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)] * [\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} g(x)]$

-   $\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)}{\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} g(x)},$ given $\lim_{x \rightarrow c} g(x) ≠ 0$

We will expand on limits in the calculus topics. Limits are important because they lead to our definition of continuity.

<br />

### Continuity {#2003}

Continuity is an important concept for statistical applications. Most of us probably have an idea of what continuity is: a function has no breaks or jumps within a certain interval. Let us introduce a more formal definition.

<br />

Suppose that the function $f$ has an interval containing point $c$.

$f$ is continuous at point $c$, if these 2 criteria are both met:

1.  $\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)$ exists (i.e. it approaches the same $y$ value at $x=c$ on both sides.
2.  $\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) = f(c)$ (i.e. the value $f$ approaches on both sides of $x=c$, is also the value of $f$ at point $c$).

<br />

We can test our intuition about continuity with the above mathematical definition:

-   If the function has a break at point $c$, it won't be defined at $f(c)$. Thus, criteria 2 will not be met.

-   If the function has a sudden "jump" at point $c$, then $\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)$ won't exist, since it is approaching point $c$ towards two different $y$ values.

<br />

The following are properties of continuity:

-   If functions $f$ and $g$ are both continuous at $x=c$, and where $\alpha$ represents a constant, then the functions $f + g$, $f - g$, $f * g$ , $|f|$, and $\alpha * f$ are also continuous at $x = c$

-   If functions $f$ and $g$ are both continuous at $x=c$, then $f / g$ is continuous at $x=c$, given that $g(c) ≠ 0$

-   If $f$ is continuous at interval $[a,b]$, then $f$ has a maximum and mininum value within $[a,b]$

<br />

# Exponents and Logarithms {#exponents}

[Properties of Exponents](#3001) \| [Logarithms](#3002)

### Properties of Exponents {#3001}

These are some key properties of exponents and exponential functions:

-   $a^x*a^y = a^{x+y}$

-   $a^{-x} = \frac{1}{a^x}$

-   $\frac{a^x}{a^y} = a^{x-y}$

-   $(a^x)^y = a^{x*y}$

-   $a^0 = 1$

<br />\
Another important topic to understand is how to solve for $x$ taken to an exponent. Let us take the equation $x^{0.7} = 5$, and solve for x

$x^{0.7} = 5$

$(x^{0.7})^{\frac{1}{0.7}} = 5^{\frac{1}{0.7}}$ (take both sides to the inverse power to cancel out exponents)

$x = 5^{\frac{1}{0.7}} = 5^{1.4828}$

<br />

We can generalise this to the following:

$x^n = a$, $x = a^{\frac{1}{n}}$

<br />

### Logarithms {#3002}

Log functions can be thought of as the inverse for exponential functions. The relationship between the two is as follows:

$y = log_a (x) \leftarrow \rightarrow a^y = x$

<br />

$a$ is the base of the logarithm. There are two common bases that we will use in Political Science:

-   Base 10 ( $a = 10$ ): $log_{10} (x)$ is often just written as $log (x)$, without a base.

-   Base $e$ ( $a = e$ ): $log_e (x)$ is often written as $ln(x)$, also called a natural log.

Specifically in the fields of statistics and social science, we also write base $e$ $log_e(x)$ as just $log(x)$

-   This is because we will primarily be using natural logs in statistics.

<br />

Below are some key properties of logarithmic functions, that work with any base (as long as the base is consistent).

-   $log(xy) = log(x) + log(y)$

-   $log(x^y) = y * log(x)$

-   $log( \frac{1}{x} ) = -log(x)$

-   $log( \frac{x}{y} ) = log(x) - log(y)$

-   $log(1) = log(e^0)= 0$

<br />

If needed, we can also change the base of our logarithms with the following formula:

$log_b (x) = \frac{log_a (x)}{log_a (b)}$

# Summation and Product Notation {#summation}

[Summation Notation](#4001) \| [Product Notation](#4002)

### Summation Notation {#4001}

Summation Notation is a short-hand way of expressing the sums of many values.

Summation Notation is quite important in Political Science, as minimising the **sum of squared errors** is a key topic in Regression and advanced Data Science Techniques.

<br />

Summation Notation is defined as the following:

$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} x_i = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_n$

-   $i=1$ indicates that we start summing at the index $i=1$. Sometimes, you will see $i = 0$, and rarely, $i$ will be equal to something else.

-   $n$ is the value at which we stop summing. This is generally the sample size in statistics.

-   $x_i$ is the $x$ value at index value $i$. When $i = 1$, x is $x_1$, when $i = 2$, x is $x_2$, and so on.

-   What does index mean? Well, lets say you have a dataset with 100 observations $n=100$. Then, $x_1$ is the $x$ value of the 1st observation, $x_2$ is the $x$ value of the 2nd observation, and so on, until you reach the final observation $x_n$ (given sample size is $n$)

<br />

These are the properties of Summation Notation:

-   $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} cx_i = c \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} x_i$, where $c$ is some constant number

-   $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} (x_i + y_i) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} x_i + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} y_i$

-   $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} c = n * c$, where $c$ is some constant number

<br />

### Product Notation {#4002}

Product notation is a short-hand way of expressing the products of many values.

Product notation is quite important in Political Science, specifically in **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**, the primary way of determining coefficient values in a Logistic Regression.

<br />

Product Notation is defined as the following:

$\prod\limits_{i=1}^{n} x_i = x_1 * x_2 * x_3 * x_4 * ... x_n$

-   $i=1$ indicates that we start summing at the index $i=1$. Sometimes, you will see $i = 0$, and rarely, $i$ will be equal to something else.

-   $n$ is the value at which we stop multiplying. This is generally the sample size in statistics.

-   $x_i$ is the $x$ value at index value $i$. When $i = 1$, x is $x_1$, when $i = 2$, x is $x_2$, and so on.

-   What does index mean? Well, lets say you have a dataset with 100 observations $n=100$. Then, $x_1$ is the $x$ value of the 1st observation, $x_2$ is the $x$ value of the 2nd observation, and so on, until you reach the final observation $x_n$ (given sample size is $n$)

<br />

These are the properties of Product Notation:

-   $\prod\limits_{i=1}^{n} cx_i = c^n * \prod\limits_{i=1}^{n} x_i$, where $c$ is some constant number

-   $\prod\limits_{i=1}^{n} c = c^n$, where $c$ is some constant number

<br />

We can also transition between [Summation Notation](#4001) and Product Notation with Logarithms, which is important in Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).

$log( \prod\limits_{i=1}^{n} x_i ) = log(x_1 * x_2 * x_3 * ... * x_n)$

$= log(x_1) + log(x_2) + log(x_3) + ... + log(x_n)$

$= \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} log(x_i$\$

<br />

We can also add a constant $c$ for a more general rule:

$log( \prod\limits_{i=1}^{n} cx_i) = log(cx_1 * cx_2 * ... * cx_n)$

$= log(c^n * x_1 * x_2 *... *x_n)$ (because we can group all the $c$ together as $c^n$

$= log(c^n) + log(x_1) + log(x_2) + ... + log(x_n)$

$= n log(c) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} log(x_i)$

<br />
