# Area Under the Curve (Riemann Sums) {#area}

As we discussed in the previous lesson, integrals are not only the opposite of derivatives - they are also a function for the area under a curve.

For example, if we have a function $f(x)$, then the integral $F(x)$ would be the function for the area under the curve $f(x)$.

<br />

#### Calculating Area Under the Curve

Riemann Sum is a method to determine the area under a curve $f(x)$, in some interval $a ≤ x ≤ b$. The method is quite intuitive:

-   Say that we have a curve $f(x)$. How would we intuitively measure the area under the curve between $x=[a,b]$?

-   Well, we could split the range between $[a,b]$ into smaller intervals.

-   For each interval, we would draw a straight vertical line from the left side of the interval on the $x$ axis, to the curve of $f(x)$

-   This gives us a rectangle. If we do it for all intervals we split $x=[a,b]$ into, we will have a series of rectangles that will somewhat approximate the area under the curve.

<br />

For a more intuitive illustration, consult the following image:

<br />

As we can see, the more segments we divide the range $x=[a,b]$ into, the more accurate estimation we get. The more segments, also means each segment's length is shorter.

<br />

#### Riemann Sum

Riemann sum is a way to express what we just intuitively described in a more mathematical way.

<br />

First, we would need to calculate the area of one rectangle. A rectangle is width times height.

-   We know the height is the value of $f(x)-0$ at the start/end of the rectangle (doesn't really matter).

-   Let us define the width of one rectangle as $\Delta x$. Why? well, each rectangle's start $x$ and end $x$ is the change in $x$, so $\Delta x$ makes sense.

Thus, we know the area of one rectangle is:

$$
=f(x) \Delta x
$$

<br />

Now, we want to calculate the sum of all the rectangles in this region to approximate the area under the curve. We can express this with a summation notation:

$$
\int\limits_a^b f(x)dx = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \Delta x
$$

<br />

Now, to get a more accurate estimation of the area under the curve, we want to reduce the width of each rectangle $\Delta x$. We can use a limit to express this idea - infinitely reducing $\Delta x$ until it approaches 0:

$$
\int\limits_a^b f(x)dx = \lim\limits_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \Delta x
$$

<br />

This above equation is the Riemann Integral, a way to calculate the definite integral (area under the curve between points $a$ and $b$).

-   With this rule, we can, in theory, calculate any integral.

-   However, doing a Riemann Sum is very time consuming, so it isn't ideal. We will discuss an often quicker way to find integrals in the following section on the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

# Fundamental Theorem of Calculus {#theorem}

So far, we have covered how you find an integral with the Riemann Sum. As noted above, this isn't always the most efficient way (almost never is) to calculate an integral.

<br />

The fundamental theorem of calculus states that, if these conditions are met:

1.  Function $F$ is continuous on interval $[a, b]$
2.  The derivative of function $F$, $F'(x) = f(x)$
3.  The function $f$ is Riemann Integrable

Then, the following statement is true:

$$
\int\limits_a^b f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

<br />

The implication of this rule is that, if we know the antiderivative/indefinite integral of $f$ (as we covered in the last lesson), then, we can solve for the area under the curve of $f$, simply by plugging in $b$ and $a$ into the indefinite integral function $F$.

<br />

#### Example 1:

Find the area under the curve between $x = [1,5]$ for the function $f(x) = 3x^2$

$$
\text{first, let us find the indefinite integral}
$$

$$
F(x) = \int 3x^2 dx
$$

$$
F(x) = 3 \int x^2dx
$$

$$
F(x) = 3 * \frac{1}{3} x^3 + c
$$

$$
F(x) = x^3 + c
$$

$$
\text{now, let us use the funamental theorem of calculus}
$$

$$
\int\limits_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

$$
\int\limits_1^5 f(x)dx = [(5)^3 + c] - [(1)^3 + c]
$$

$$
\int\limits_1^5 f(x)dx = 125 + c - 1 - c
$$

$$
\int\limits_1^5 f(x)dx = 124
$$

NOTE: see how the $c$ cancels out with another $c$

# Properties of Definite Integrals {#properties}

There are a few properties of definite integrals:

$$
1. \int\limits_a^a f(x)dx = 0, \text{ no area under a point}
$$

$$
2. \int\limits_a^b f(x)dx = - \int\limits_b^a f(x)dx
$$

$$
3. \int\limits_a^b [f(x) + g(x)]dx = \int\limits_a^b f(x)dx + \int\limits_a^b g(x)dx
$$

$$
4. \int\limits_a^b [\alpha f(x)]dx = \alpha \int\limits_a^b f(x)dx
$$

$$
5. \int\limits_a^b f(x)dx + \int\limits_b^c f(x)dx = \int\limits_a^c f(x)dx
$$
