# Exponents {#exponents}

These are some key properties of exponents and exponential functions:

$$
1. \space a^x*a^y = a^{x+y}
$$

$$
2. \space a^{-x} = \frac{1}{a^x}
$$

$$
3.  \space \frac{a^x}{a^y} = a^{x-y}
$$

$$
4.  \space (a^x)^y = a^{x*y}
$$

$$
5. \space a^0 = 1
$$

<br />

#### Solving Exponential Bases

Another important topic to understand is how to solve for $x$ taken to an exponent. Let us take the equation $x^{0.7} = 5$, and solve for x

$$
x^{0.7} = 5
$$

$$
(x^{0.7})^{\frac{1}{0.7}} = 5^{\frac{1}{0.7}}
$$

$$
x = 5^{\frac{1}{0.7}} = 5^{1.4828}
$$

<br />

We can generalise this to the following:

$$
x^n = a, x = a^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

# Logarithms {#logarithms}

Log functions can be thought of as the inverse for exponential functions. The relationship between the two is as follows:

$$
y = log_a (x) \leftarrow \rightarrow a^y = x
$$

<br />

$a$ is the base of the logarithm. There are two common bases that we will use in Political Science:

-   Base 10 ( $a = 10$ ): $log_{10} (x)$ is often just written as $log (x)$, without a base.

-   Base $e$ ( $a = e$ ): $log_e (x)$ is often written as $ln(x)$, also called a natural log.

Specifically in the fields of statistics and social science, we also write base $e$ $log_e(x)$ as just $log(x)$

-   This is because we will primarily be using natural logs in statistics.

<br />

#### Properties of Logarithms

Below are some key properties of logarithmic functions, that work with any base (as long as the base is consistent).

$$
1. \space log(xy) = log(x) + log(y)
$$

$$
2. \space log(x^y) = y * log(x)
$$

$$
3. \space log( \frac{1}{x} ) = -log(x)
$$

$$
4. \space log( \frac{x}{y} ) = log(x) - log(y)
$$

$$
5. \space log(1) = log(e^0)= 0
$$

<br />

#### Changing Bases of Logarithms

If needed, we can also change the base of our logarithms with the following formula:

$$
log_b (x) = \frac{log_a (x)}{log_a (b)}
$$
