This course covers some of the key topics in algebra, calculus, and linear algebra needed to understand the methods behind political science.

The point of this course is not meant to be a thorough explanation of math topics - it is instead to install practical skills which will be useful in research. Thus, I will not be going through many proofs of concepts.

<br />

**Prerequisites**: Algebra to the level of a typical secondary education.

Note: You don't need to study this course from beginning to end - you can focus on particular areas where you may struggle with.

<br />
